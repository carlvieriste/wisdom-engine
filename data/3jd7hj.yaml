      and although it has become popular to bash him, please keep in mind that he
      really was the first one.  He opened the book on oriental practices in the west,

      Alan Watts was the first one, and as such, he wasn''t privy to all of the wonderful
      knowledge that has occurred in his wake.  We should all be thankful to him,
      because without his contribution, we wouldn''t be where we are today with this
      research.'

    How is Daoist meditation different from Zen meditation?

    '
  __replies:
  - body: "Glad to hear you are interested in this subject so much.\n\nIn order:\n\
      Daoism and Zen have a historical connection because of the confluence of Daoist\
      \ and Buddhist ideas, post Song dynasty period.   Zen practice is often seen\
      \ as the combination of Daoist concepts within the realm of Buddhism, whereas\
      \ Quanzhen Daoism is often seen as a combination of Buddhist ideas within Daoism.\n\
      Zen meditation places the most focus on enlightenment and following the practice\
      \ Koans, as well as seated meditation.  Zen in China works somewhat differently\
      \ than Zen in Japan as it has a stronger religious component and is often mixed\
      \ up quite badly in superstition,\nDaoism doesn't practice Koans, but rather\
      \ uses textual interpretation as a way to aid meditation practice.\nThe key\
      \ difference being that Daoist practice at the start is about 70% textual and\
      \ 30% practice based.\nDaoism mainly focuses on the cultivation of \"Dan\" or\
      \ elixir and follows meditation practices which develop the three treasures\
      \ of \"jing, qi, and shen\" which are considered to be the same as \"essence,\
      \ energy, and spirit.\"  The system of developing these is typically associated\
      \ with the concept of Dantian, or energy field and the San Tian or San Ting,\
      \ which refers to the energy centres in the head, chest, and stomach.\nIt is\
      \ really rather much more complex than that, but those are the basics.\nThe\
      \ end goal of Daoism is \"cheng xian,\" or to achieve immortality.\nWhether\
      \ this is possible or not is out of my experience, since as far as I know I've\
      \ never met anyone who has achieved this skill, although I have met various\
      \ high level people in Daoism and Buddhism, some of whom could perform very\
      \ interesting energetic feats.\n\nRegarding the second question, this is a very\
      \ important topic right now, as the Daoist scholarly community is quite divided\
      \ about what Daoism actually is.\nTraditionally in Chinese thought, post Qing\
      \ dynasty (post 1911 at the start of the Republican era), Daoism is split into\
      \ three main concepts,\n- Dao jia: the philosophical school of Laozi, Zhuangzi,\
      \ Liezi and so on\n- Dao Jiao: Daoist religion, specifically Quanzhen Daoism\
      \ and Zhengyi Daoism, the two major modern sects of the religion\n- Dan Dao:\
      \  the elixir practice of Daoism, which is essentially based on meditation.\n\
      \nActually, before the republican period, Daoism was never separated into different\
      \ schools and simply existed as a continuum which contained religion, philosophy,\
      \ and practice.  With the suppression of religion during the cultural revolution,\
      \ many important aspects of Daoism went underground or became less popular.\
      \  After the opening of China in the 1980s, the religious environment also became\
      \ more open and Longmen sect Daoism of the Quanzhen school became the nationally\
      \ recognized head branch of Daoism in China.   In fact, there are many sects\
      \ of Daoism and many different ways of practising the Dao.  It would not be\
      \ fair to say one is more correct than another, but basically, all Daoist practices\
      \ trace back to Laozi.\nThe situation of Daoist temples in China is not very\
      \ good, with the head temple in Beijing being the white cloud temple.   White\
      \ cloud temple has a Chinese Daoist research association which was headed up\
      \ by Master Hu Haiya until he died two years ago.\nHu Haiya was one of the most\
      \ important figures in modern Daoism, as he was the direct student of Cheng\
      \ Yingning, the person who during the republican era essentially created the\
      \ term \"secular Daoism.\"\nUnfortunately, most temples in China are poorly\
      \ taken care of and the monks no longer meditate, preferring instead to chant,\
      \ do incantations of various kinds, and promote the religion to their perish,\
      \ who are mostly superstitious countryside folks.\nMy teacher actually taught\
      \ meditation techniques to a number of priests in Sichuan, because the techniques\
      \ had been lost in their temples.\nThe current academic situation of Daoism\
      \ in the west is also not very good, as there is a major divide between people\
      \ who advocate a purely philosophical or purely religious approach to Daoism.\n\
      There is a great deal of evidence to show that Daoism is the unifying concept\
      \ of Ancient Chinese culture, but to actually call oneself a Daoist is somewhat\
      \ without meaning.   A Daoist, after a sense, has never existed in Chinese history.\
      \  The closest thing would be Daoshi, or Daoist priest, but even then, this\
      \ is something which should be treated under scrutiny, since many people use\
      \ this concept to advertise their books and so on.\nThe fact of the matter is\
      \ that there have been many lay people within Chinese history who practised\
      \ Daoism, some very important examples being\nLu Dongbin: creator of the jin\
      \ dan school of Daoist meditation.\nZhang Boduan: creator of the Quanzhen Southern\
      \ school and writer of the document \"understanding reality.\"\nHuang Yuanji:\
      \ who although he was a priest, wrote a very important book called \"the genuine\
      \ explanation of the Dao De jing,\" which was specifically made to teach lay\
      \ people how to meditate (it is my favourite book)\nand more recently \nCheng\
      \ Yingning:  a modern Dao Daoist who passed away during the cultural revolution\
      \ period.  He wrote the book \"Immortality study,\" and said that Daoism does\
      \ not belong to anyone, or any religious group, it is simply the study and practice\
      \ of attaining immortality.\nIn terms of people calling themselves Daoists,\
      \ I don't have any qualm with it, since we all bring different things to the\
      \ table.\nI personally practice Daoism, but I'm not a priest, nor am I trained\
      \ in any ceremonies.  My teacher is a lay person who happened to study with\
      \ the head priest of Quanzhen Daoism.  I think there are many examples of this\
      \ happening throughout history.\n\nThere are 5000 books in the Daoist Cannon,\
      \ with 500 dedicated to meditation practice.  Most of them have never been translated\
      \ to English and many of them are written in code.  Really studying Daoism in\
      \ a deep way is very time consuming and demanding.  My advice is first to have\
      \ a look at www.ctext.org, which is an excellent classical document site with\
      \ many documents being available both in classical Chinese and English.\nRemember\
      \ not to trust everything you read and cross reference as much as possible.\n\
      It took me a full year to read the Dao De jing in Chinese and I've been reading\
      \ some classics for more than two years just to get their basic concepts.\n\
      If you really like the practice, you will find the time to dedicate yourself\
      \ to it.\n:)"

- __0title: what is self cultivation ?
  __replies:
  - body: 'Self cultivation in Chinese language is called "Yang Sheng," it literally
      means to nurture life.  Basically, Yang Sheng is a Chinese concept that bridges
      different genres, from Daoism to medicine, to Buddhism, to food and sport culture
      and so on.

      This concept is strongly tied into the core principle of Daoism, which is to
      treat day to day life as a kind of practice space, which can yield the result
      of developing a longer, happier life.

      Self cultivation in a sense is actually akin to a farmer cultivating a field.

      The seeds are practice (of meditation, reading, writing, art, cooking or anything
      else imaginable that could yield benefits to ones'' person), and the crop is
      the result of the practice, be it in your day to day life, in the spiritual
      realm, in relationships, or whatever it may be.

      Self cultivation is the key principle of Daoist practices and ties the philosophy
      together with the individual practitioner''s experience of life.'

  __replies:
  - body: '1:

      Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism are very closely related to each other.

      Quanzhen in its later stages really became a combination of the three.

      There is much disagreement in classical literature about their exact relationship,
      with people like Huang yuanji and Cheng Yingning suggesting that they are of
      the same Dao, whereas people like Zhu Xi suggesting the only Daoism and Confucianism
      were connected closely.

      It is my opinion that all religious practice in China is filtered through Daoism
      and Confucianism to a great extent.  Buddhism will read differently in Chinese
      than it does in other languages.  There is a famous painting of Confucius handing
      the baby Buddha to Laozi,  I think it speaks volumes about how Chinese people
      see Buddhism in relationship to the other two pillars.

      2:  if you trace Qigong back to a time before it was called qigong, you will
      find rather a great deal of evidence to support that it was practiced along
      with meditation.  The book yang sheng lei yao, which is a late qing dynasty
      period neigong classic has tonnes of Daoist yoga style exercises which can help
      people become more healthy.  Keep in mind that Chinese culture didn''t become
      clearly codified until post the post republican period and nationalism period.  historically,
      there is really a great deal of room for movement and lack of clarity. It is
      one of the things which makes the field so interesting.

      3:

      There are many people who practice neidan.  I recently met a master in Taiwan
      who could transfer qi directly to my dantian and through my ren and du mai meridians.  it
      was freaky.   I have to say this though, the people who practice nei dan and
      are not superstitious whack jobs are very few and far between.  There are many
      lay people who practice nei dan at a high level but who you would never meet
      unless destiny throws you in their direction.

      I don''t want to push my book too hard, but I strongly suggest you give it a
      read, it is absolutely full of useful information about neidan practice.'

  body: '1.) To what extent are Daoism (particularly Quanzhen) and Buddhism compatible
    (particularly their methods and meditations, such as neidan vs esoteric Buddhist
    practice of mantra, mudra, etc.) in your opinion, or in other words is a dual
    cultivation of both something that occurs in Chinese Daoism? One often hears of
    a theoretical "san jiao he yi" or unity of the three teachings, but when it comes
    to actual practice is this something that occurs?


    2.) What relation, if any, are modern qigong/neigong practices to authentic Daoist
    cultivation? I''ve heard some claim there is only a vague or little relation between
    the two. Is practicing qigong beneficial to Daoist cultivation?


    3.) How many authentic Daoist masters of neidan do you estimate are still in China
    and how possible is it for a Westerner to be initiated into these practices?'

  - body: 'Actually, my teacher doesn''t believe in immortality, basically he says
      that this is a level at which the mind and the universe meld and so to the ancients
      it might have seemed as though they had attained immortality.

      There are many very strange practices such as self mumification which were popular
      in ancient China, but it is probably a good idea just to cultivate oneself as
      fully as possible without actually having to kick to bucket intentionally.  You
      are likely going to die either way, better to die healthy.

      I don''t know what the highest level of achievement is, since I haven''t experienced
      it directly.  I have met some people with very interesting skills though, being
      able to transfer energy directly to others for various purposes, and one person
      even being able to cause me to have a spiritual waking dream through his chanting.

      At the end of the day though, the most important thing is ones own experience
      and the acceptance that one may only speak to their own level of practice.'

  __replies:
  - body: 'Daoist arts have always been on the outside of the Daoist circle.

      Daoist theory in general works according to the pre and post heaven theory of
      the yijing.  the only way to achieve the pre heaven state is through meditation,
      because this state infers going from non action to action without action, so
      it requires that the body go through a long period of not moving before the
      pre heaven qi can begin to circulate.  I think this is quite commonly accepted
      in Daoist thinking.  Because all art requires movement of some kind, it is always
      relegated to the post heaven.  Having said that, post heaven practices such
      as feng shui, chanting, qigong and so on are all part of the bigger picture
      of Daoism and I think most people accept them as being useful.

      In terms of the academy, most scholars studying Daoism don''t actually practice,
      which means that their ideas must be treated carefully.   The key of Daoism
      as a study is that it requires practice.

      Most modern Chinese people are afraid of religion, and although Buddhism has
      become quite popular, Daoism still has a bit of a bad taste, as the majority
      of religious Daoists, including priests, are mostly very strange and apt to
      believe all kinds of weird stuff.

      Taiwan is a good example of a country which has a great deal of religious Daoism
      going on.   Unfortunately it tends to be the case that religious Daoist people
      are not very practical, and although sometimes they have very real skills, they
      almost always lose some of the benefit of them through their whacky beliefs.  Cheng
      Yingning believed that it was possible to study religious documents and use
      them as code to understand meditation.'

      From the standpoint of someone who does neidan meditation, my daily practice
      involves reading classical documents and putting them into practice via meditation.

      I usually read Chinese documents for at least an hour and meditate for a similar
      amount of time.

      I also do Cha Dao, which is modern Taiwanese tea ceremony, and all though it
      is not closely related to any Daoist school, it has cross over.

      The problem in talking about what Daoists do is that there really is no rule
      for anyone who isn''t practicing within the religious context.

      Cheng Yingning created the term secular Daoist during the 1930s and I strongly
      believe in his approach, which is treating Daoism as a holistic study of self,
      rather than as a superstitious religion.'

      problem is that the path is very steep and hard to access, so many people assume

      propaganda in post Deng China that says that China has a great 5000 year culture,
      but the culture is only useful if people can actually use it to benefit themselves.  And
      anyway, Europe has about 6000 years of written culture, starting in the Aegean,
      so I don't know what the Chinese media is on about anyway.

      occur until the Tang dynasty, and although the foundation was set in place in
      the Shang and Zhou dynasties, most of China''s genuine development was much
      later.

      I do Cha Dao very seriously and one thing many people don''t know is that modern
      Chinese Chadao was created in Taiwan about 40 years ago by a mister Zhou Yu,
      who I have personally met and chatted with about his creation.  He used ancient
      methods lost by the Chinese and kept by Japan and Korea, along with British
      ideas to create the famous tea ceremony that you can see in any Chinese tea
      market.  All these things like glass pouring cups, bamboo scoops and so on only
      have about 40 years of history at the max.  Many Chinese people believe them
      to be up to 4000 years old, having started with Shen Nong.

  body: 'Wow, this thread is quite popular, thanks a lot for doing it! I''ll have
    to take some time to read the whole thing carefully but I just wanted to ask --
    well, I''m someone who studied TCM, and while it was at times very rewarding,
    it was also very frustrating. I started to feel like I was hitting a wall of what
    I call TCM fundamentalism, and while I agree that a close reading of the classics
    is essential, I frankly don''t feel like that''s sole valid basis for this kind
    of metaphysical knowledge.


    So my question is: have you run into much frustration dealing with teachers who
    are rigidly dogmatic, even nationalistic, in their ideologies, and how did you
    overcome/incorporate those experiences? Cheers. By the way I''m also in China
    -- southwest here. '

- __0title: 1) Which part of Daoist self cultivation ensures that a Yang Shen body
    will be achieved, and that Mi
  __replies:
  - body: '1) you can consider ming basically to represent the life of the body and
      xing to represent the mind.  the mind and body are cultivated through non action
      and later action without action.  Each school will do this differently.  The
      key is to achieve a natural state of being and let the energy move by itself.
      There are many stages of this practice)

      2) No, many people don''t practice neidan. Daoism also has the idea that it
      is possible to cultivate oneself through arts, culture, religious activities
      and so on.  Nei Dan is the most direct way to practice Qi though.

      3) first you should achieve "yuan jing," when the essence of the body begins
      to circulate around the ren mai and du mai meridians (up the back and down the
      front of the body), After that there will be many different stages, they don''t
      have to move in any specific order and are quite random. A very common early
      stage is to achieve "mystery gate," which is basically the door through which
      one enters action without action.

      4) yes, I am at the stage where my meridians are clearing out.  Yuan jing should
      happen fairly quickly, usually within a year or two.  I mainly follow the middle
      school method, which uses the area around the solar plexus (zhong gong) in a
      way similar to how other schools use dantian or qixue.

      5) happiness and health until I die

      6) Daoists cultivate the three treasures and Dan.  They are different only until
      the advanced level, at which point they tend to converge.  The middle school
      is a good example of this convergence

      7) I personally prefer quanzhen Daoism, especially the middle school, but the
      southern school is also great.  From a document perspective at least.  Lu Dongbin''s
      jindan school also has very good documents.  As far as actual schools which
      can be visited and so on, I don''t know, there really are a lot of flaked in
      Daoism, it can be hard to find a teacher.  I don''t like religion and I don''t
      think meditation requires belief in gods, but I do respect religious people
      who have gone to a high level of achievement.

      8: if you can read classical Chinese, I strongly suggest you read Lu Dongbin''s
      poetry, especially "qi zi," and "lu zu bai zi bei."  Also, Dao De Jing Jiang
      yi,  understanding reality,  there are so many.  I would advise reading Quanzhen
      books first, as Lingbao methods are very highly written in code, and Maoshan
      stuff is pretty whacky.

      9: I''m not experienced in yoga, could you phrase that differently?

      10: I don''t know that person, sorry.'

  __replies:
  - body: 'Mostly Chinese classical documents, but the Dao De Jing and zhuangzi can
      both be treated as meditation books too.

      consider:

      empty the heart,

      fill the belly,

      soften the will,

      strengthen the bones,

      forever the people will be without desire or knowledge,

      he who knows this has no reason to be brave,

      acting without action,

      he has no reason to control.


      This is very applicable to meditation and you can use it today.

      the heart refers to the mind, the stomach refers to breathing into the lower
      dantian area near the navel, softening the will means that you should make your
      intention soft, strengthening the bones means you can sit with an upright posture,
      or can also mean that you should consolidate your mind deeply in the core of
      your body.'

  __replies:
  - body: 'I haven''t found any books in English that I really like yet.

      Many people like Michael Saso''s work, but he is very specific to the Zhengyi
      sect and he says himself that he doesn''t trust Longmen priests (he says he
      likes the nuns more, because they have a more genuine practice.  He lived in
      situ, I didn''t, so I''ll take his word for it).

      In terms of neidan practice, I haven''t read any books which have convinced
      me.  I released my first book recently which is a beginner level practice guide
      for neidan.  You can check it out if you want.

      In terms of philosophy books.

      all the usual suspects such as Cleary, Wang and so on have disseminated things
      fairly well. If you read twenty translations of the DDJ you can begin to get
      the idea that it is quite a fluid book in terms of meaning.

      I suggest that you just read and read and read and eventually you will distil
      something from it all.

      If you want to read a modern day genius, check out Peter Ralston.  He is fantastically
      good about meditation practices, albeit not Daoism specifically.  He is probably
      the best English language writer on the subject of consciousness.'

      - the path up the mountain is different, but the mountain is still the same
      place.  Daoism focuses on building Qi and the health as a route to enlightenment.  Daoism
      is the one practice in the world of spirituality that views the spirit as residing
      within the body and not outside of it.

      - Chinese culture is a vast web and every part interacts at some point with
      every other part.  Confucian, Daoist, Buddhist, Mohist, legalist, and even Maoist
      teachings all converge at some point or another, only to break again.  They
      are all based on wuji- taiji- sizhen - bagua- etc...

    that later daoism seems to be about. For someone outside of the chinese culture
    it seems inpenetrable whearas the lao tzu and zhuangzi seem so timeless and transcendant
    of cultures. I feel like there''s value in the later developments but I just haven''t
    been able to connect with it. I''m not quite sure what my question is here. Maybe

  __replies:
  - body: '- I don''t think very much is known about this period, as it really wasn''t
      very well documented.  Chinese history really gets going during the Tang dynasty.

      - No, I don''t think anyone has thought of themselves as Daoist until quite
      recently.  Religion in China is much more amorphous than religion in the west,
      and Daoism has never been defined by one school or lineage.

      - Many people go to great lengths to split hairs on this subject.  To me it
      is almost totally unimportant from a practical perspective.  Academics get payed
      to deconstruct things, but it doesn''t mean they learn the subject deeply.  Laozi
      only left a book, Zhuangzi only left some stories.  Certainly they have had
      things added to them and subtracted from them over the years, and Liji probably
      wasn''t written by the Duke of Zhou, but they are all great books and well worth
      reading  :)'

  - body: 'the practices you are talking about are very post heaven and also somewhat
      destructive if approached carelessly.

      you really don''t want to get your qi stuck up in your head and chest all the
      time. It needs to go everywhere in the body.   I will just be direct, real Neidan
      is based on non action and action without action, it can only be achieved through
      quiet emptiness and stillness.   there are many post birth techniques that stimulate
      jing and so on, but they are more closely related to qigong and medicine than
      daoism.  Any technique that does not feel balanced, causes unhealthy feeling
      things to happen to you, or otherwise doesn''t seem right simply isn''t right.  you
      only have one body, you need to be careful with it.  Many students have hurt
      themselves by using overly forceful techniques espoused by banxian (half immortal,
      a common Chinese slang for half baked religious teachers) teachers and some
      of my friends had to undergo long and costly TCM treatments to fix the damage
      caused to them by these techniques.

      I have never read Cleary''s book, so I can''t comment on it.  He is very famous,
      I''m going to check it out, I am also interested in keeping it for my reference

  body: 'Thank you so much for offering your time and insight! I am extremely excited
    by this AMA as it''s a topic that I''ve been trying to learn more about and have
    been having trouble finding trustworthy resources on.


    I trained for three months in qigong and taiji at Wudangshan with a SanFangPei
    master. Wuji was also lightly covered. I barley speak Mandarin so much was lost
    in translation. I have also studied a fair amount of other styles of meditation,
    mainly Tibetan Buddhist, Zen, and Raja Yoga.


    1) What would you consider to be the best English resource on Daoist meditation
    at the intermediate/advanced levels? I believe I have a good understanding of
    the basic breath cycle and postures. I am particularly curious to learn more about
    any Daoist systems which include visualization or pranayama work. I believe there
    are some and I know very little about them.


    2) The sect I trained with made a big deal out of the interplay between wuji,
    taiji, and liangyi for thorough cultivation. Is this a foundational thing for
    most Daoist systems or were they unusual in focusing on these because of their
    more martial focus?


    3) The sect I trained with seemed to want me to avoid channeling qi through the
    lower dantian when cycling my breath because it might be destabilizing. Most of
    their focus was on the middle and upper, in the context of cultivating longevity.
    Do other Daoists place more equal focus on the three different centers? Or was
    this the type of thing they don''t want beginners to mess with?


    4) What''s your opinion on the translations of the selections in the Thomas Clearly
    "Taoist Meditation: Methods for Cultivating a Healthy Mind and Body?" book? It''s
    one of the only books I''ve been able to find on the subject. In particular, I
    find "The Cultivation of Realization" fascinating because I can pick up on a lot
    of Buddhist term that I''m familiar with that they use to explain Daoist concepts
    of related teachings.


    5) Do Mantak Chia''s works follow traditional Daoist teachings or is a lot of
    it his own stuff?


    6) Are there any good places to specifically train in Daoist meditation techniques
    in English?


    7) I see someone already asked you if you could compare Daoist meditation with
    zazen. Could you compare it with shamatha/vipassana?


    8) Do you recommend any particular Tao Te Ching translation over others? I have
    several and some of them are remarkably different from others.


    I could totally go on but I see you''ve answered a bunch of other questions already
    and I don''t want to hog you too much. Thanks again!'

  __replies:
  - body: "1: no direct relationship. sun lutang and others were part of a republican\
      \ government strategy (read Marrow of a Nation) to popularize kung fu as the\
      \ Chinese ethnic sport (just like yoga was in India).   Kung fu hitherto had\
      \ been some nasty stuff (my lineage ancestors almost all killed many people\
      \ when they guarded caravans crossing Hebei and Shanxi provinces).   Sun Lutang\
      \ was part of a drive to popularize the idea that kung fu and Daoism/Buddhism\
      \ had some relevant connection.\nKung fu should be considered as a \"hou tian,\"\
      \ or post birth practice, whereas neidan is a \"xiantian,\" pre birth practice.\
      \  The pre birth stage is likened the the foetus in the womb, it is basically\
      \ without action or knowledge, but very dynamically growing and becoming alive.\
      \  Xiantian can only be achieved through quiet meditation and in no other way.\n\
      Sun Lutang's idea that martial arts could cultivate Xiantian practice is technically\
      \ wrong by Daoist standards, although it may comply with TCM standards, I don't\
      \ know.\n2: xing involves the use of the mind, ming involves the life energy\
      \ of the body.   This is very well detailed in the book \"xing ming gui zhi,\"\
      \ which was  a middle school (zhong pai) book made available during the ming\
      \ qing era for lay people to learn to meditate.\n3:  This is not true at all,\
      \ it is just a bunch of advertising created by people who want to promote their\
      \ own way of doing things.\nsome sects such as Zhengyi put more focus on ritual\
      \ than meditation and technically can't achieve the xiantian state through their\
      \ practices.  When Lu Dongbin and Zhang Boduan wrote their books, it was specifically\
      \ to rectify the idiotic problems in Daoism that had arisen during the time\
      \ of lingbao Daoism, and the earlier Tianshi movement.   Before jindan and quanzhen\
      \ daoism, people were stilling doing external alchemy, magic and other things\
      \ that badly hurt them and their students.   Quanzhen meditation is a revolution\
      \ to Daoist thinking, where the teaching was taken back to the root of Laozi's\
      \ non action.   Zhang Boduan actually said \"the small hermit lives in the forest,\
      \ the great hermit lives in the city,\" and advised people not to become monks,\
      \ but rather cultivate themselves while living normal lives.\nThere is a great\
      \ deal of research in China that suggests that Quanzhen only took on religious\
      \ characteristics when Qu Qiuji preached the Dao to Ghengis Khan.  It is considered\
      \ that in order to sway Khan, he had to create some sort of story to convince\
      \ him, and religion was the easiest way.\nZhang Boduan, Han Zhongli, and Lu\
      \ Dongbin, as well as Huang Yuanji, his students, and Cheng Yingning/Hu Haiya\
      \ always advocated research of meditation as the way to achieve the Dao.   These\
      \ are also the most important post Tang dynasty founding fathers of Daoist schools.\
      \  \nI don't want to tear too hard on Zhengyi and the Maoshan tradition, but\
      \ the schools that still exist in Taiwan, Fujian and so on are mostly very superstitious\
      \ and superficial.  Quanzhen Daoism really holds the standard in terms of self\
      \ cultivation techniques."

  - body: 'Actually, drawing the fire upward is a misunderstanding of the basic misunderstanding
      of Daoist principles.   Daoists don''t actively pull anything up, rather they
      simply focus on emptiness and the energy moves by itself.

      The reason for this misconception that they pull the testicles in is because
      of a specific stage in training where the wei lu point and hui yin near the
      anus and testicles begins to move on its own and the testicles pull in to the
      body in men.  This testicle retraction is natural and shouldn''t be forced.  This
      is when the yuan jing movement in the body has become good enough that it starts
      to clear the yin qiao meridian in the legs.   This also may have some relationship
      with the hormones.   This isn''t a practice so much as a symptom of practice.  Controlling
      sexuality is about ones'' ability to control oneself.

      If you are not a monk or a hermit, then sex is a normal thing to do.  Too much
      of a good thing becomes a bad thing, so as long as you can control your desire,
      you can enjoy meditating and have a regular sex life.

      typically, younger people can have sex more than older people because it uses
      less of their energy.  once people are over fifty or so, they should reduce
      the amount of sex they have.   At least that is what my teacher told me, from
      a Chinese medicine standpoint.'

  - body: 'People who practice Daoism are often very individualistic and so it can
      be hard to cooperate sometimes when family members or friends are demanding.

      What I would suggest is to just focus on being natural and if you get frustrated,
      don''t fight it at all.  When you get angry, just set yourself down in a chair
      and try not to move at all.  Let the anger fill your body and your mind and
      just stay with it, don''t try to make it go away or avoid it.  Anger is a very
      important emotion and you will have to deal with it at some point or another.

      Your responsibility is to the child right now and until it is big enough to
      fend for itself somewhat, the responsibility is on you to take care of it.  You
      will have to find a way to keep yourself alive while you do this.

      Sorry for being so direct, but there are many things in life which are unpleasant
      and can''t be avoided.  :) :)'

      neidan practices.  I think Michael Sassos books may have some stuff on Zhengyi
      practices and doubtless there are others, but I don't have a great wealth of
      English language meditation books for Daoist purposes.   I particularly like
      several philosophical books, such as Zhuangzi speaks, and other books by the
      same group.  The "speaks," books are Chinese philosophy as represented by cartoons
      done by various Taiwanese cartoonists.  Great books.

  __replies:
  - body: 'Laozi said that all people are afraid and can''t avoid it.

      I think that fear is very natural and is a valuable emotion.

      The key to interpreting fear is simply not to over think it.

      If you are afraid, get right down to the root causes of it and adjust them if
      you have the power.   Don''t think and think and think about the fear and let
      it get worse every time you think of it.  Do you remember going to the doctor
      as a child and being so afraid of getting needles?  Every time, the needle didn''t
      really hurt that much, but you were always afraid of it right?

      How about going to the dentist?

      But getting medical and dental treatment are also very important and valuable
      right?

      That is how you should treat fear.


      Daoism actually advises to avoid searching too deeply into social affairs.  It
      advises one to be like a child, always natural and open to things as they happen.  It
      also advises to be somewhat turbid and muddy, be as you naturally are, rather
      than trying to adjust yourself to be bright and shiny at all times.  This will
      cause you to become more balanced emotionally, just resting in your own self,
      rather than making yourself something other than what you are.'

    \ read Tao Teh Ching's verses, and find it beautifully precise, but when I face\
    \ the world, I just fall into my fears again.\n\n1) What's the daoist's perception\
    \ of fear, how do you endure its magnitude in order to not be withdrawn from your\
    \ Tao?\n\nI've been also dragged away by a deep nostalgia for a few years now,\
    \ and I cannot feel peace.\n\n2) I know Taoism is pretty firm in matters of staying\
    \ in the present, but there are some mentions of both the past and the future.\
    \ My though here is, memory is quite a paradox, because our foundations are there,\
    \ and we somehow rely on them over and over again (for whatever task, skill, job,\
    \ etc), but in fact it's not a real thing. Also, and this is where I start to\
    \ drift away, memory's got a strange power over our feelings when we are not having\
    \ a good time, by displaying a wonderful scenery of good moments we've had, which\
    \ generates this sort of \"oasis\". Thus, what is the Taoist posture regarding\
    \ the past? Regarding memory?\n\nTo conclude, in case I haven't been very clear\
    \ (I apologize if that's the case) what I am trying to find answers to is: \n\n\
    3) What is the Taoist way of dealing with fear, with the lack of faith it comes\
    \ afterwards and the looping negativity that results from all these strange things?\n\

  __replies:
  - body: 'This is one thing that researchers are very torn about.

      Chinese indigenous religious practices date back to the Shang dynasty, but they
      didn''t become extremely sophisticated until the Tang dynasty and the Lingbao
      school of Daoism.  There are two camps in the argument about Chinese religion
      and Daoism, with one camp making the claim that the previous religion of the
      Zhou dynasty was simply grafted over Daoist ideas in order to give Zhang Daoling
      and then later the Xuan Zong emperor of the Tang dynasty legitimacy in the eyes
      of their followers.

      The other argument is that Daoism has its own unique set of beliefs which exist
      outside of the realm of folk religion.

      These things, while being of academic interest, may actually not be germaine
      to the question of what religious Daoism is.


      The fact is that around the end of the Qing dynasty, Daoism fell into disrepair
      and began to crop up as superstitious cults such as the boxers, Lotus sect,
      Yi Guandao (which still exists in Taiwan), and so on.  It was Chen Yingning
      who saved Daoism and who set its path back on the road of genuine self cultivation
      rather than mysticism and superstition.

      Daoism these days has a little of everything, and although there are some people
      who really have a clear idea of what it is, there are many who prefer to dwell
      within the world of belief and superstition.

      I can say one thing with certainty,

      Daoism is a study of the nature of the universe.  Religion exists within the
      nature and as such, it can be included within the study of the Dao.'

  selftext: 'My name is Robert J Coons, I am a Canadian who has studied Daoist arts
    under various masters in Canada and Asia for over a decade.

    My main teacher, Yang Hai learned from Cao Zhenren, the head master of Beijing
    white cloud temple in the late 1980s and 1990s.  He also learned several other
    schools of Daoism and has studied the entire component of the Daoist cannon dealing
    with meditation practices.

    I have personally read and translated many documents, have articles in several
    magazines including The Empty Vessel Daoist Journal, In Recovery Magazine, The
    Scholar Sage online Daoist Journal and so on.


    My emphasis in training is on self cultivation through meditation and correct
    understanding of the Daoist classics.


    Understanding that Daoist Meditation is poorly disseminated in the west, I would
    like to make this AMA mostly based around theory, technique, and benefits of meditation
    practice as it pertains to Daoism.
