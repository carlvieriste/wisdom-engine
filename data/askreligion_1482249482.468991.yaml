  selftext: 'I was having a discussion the assertion that homosexuals cannot be Christians
    because they are violating religious law and Christians cannot pick and choose
    what scripture to follow.  In response I made the argument that, according to
    the New Testament, the Old Testament is still fair game and as such, if his premise
    stands there are no Christians because everyone has violated some law (Hair cuts,
    Tattoos etc. etc.).  However, in response it was mentioned that there are 3 classifications
    of law in the Old Testament: Moral, Civil, Ceremonial.  The conclusion being that
    civil laws are specific to their geo-temporal place (The rule about round hair
    cuts was just written in because, when the Old Testament was written, that was
    part of the culture and it was understood - or is understood - that it wouldn''t
    apply in the future or in different cultures).


    This actually struck me as a valid explanation for why my original assertion is
    incorrect but I have some misgivings.


    My question is: From whence did these distinctions come?  Who said - homosexuality
    is an issue of morality but hair cuts were only a cultural thing?  If someone
    made it clear at the time the Old Testament was written then fair enough but if
    it''s just a modern day interpreter saying: This is moral; This was cultural then
    it doesn''t seem like the argument holds much weight and it''s just a religious
    authority figure that''s doing the picking and choosing.


    TL;DR - Who made the distinction between Moral, Civil and Ceremonial law in the
    Old Testament (Was it written into the scripture or by a religious figure of the
    time or is it a modern interpretation?)?'

  selftext: 'What has Christian theology taught Jesus'' body to exist? He ascended
    into heaven, which I suppose either means the sky, the afterlife, or both, but
    each leaves me with some questions.


    The afterlife is generally taken as purely formal, and therefore non-material,
    and therefore would not have Jesus'' body. Presumably the Apostles Creed saying
    "He is seated at the right hand of the Father" is not taken literally. But it
    also seems inappropriate to think of Jesus as just floating around space somewhere.


    Is it just understood that a glorified body of the resurrection can exist in this
    kinda quasi-material state? Is this the "subtlety" of the body talked about in
    the *Summa Theologica*, III, Q. 83?


    Long story short, according to Christian thought is Jesus still flesh and blood
    this very day, excluding any kind of "transubstantiation" response?'

  selftext: "I have gone through a dilemma for several years. I grew up a devout Muslim.\
    \ I still consider myself Muslim even though I feel conflicted. I would attend\
    \ weekend Islamic school from the age of around 4 until I was 13. Slowly, and\
    \ slowly I became disillusioned with organized religion. The picture most of my\
    \ Muslim brothers and sisters drew of God was a picture of a mad, vengeful, and\
    \ wrathful God. A God that accepts only 'Islam' as the legitimate framework to\
    \ live one's life - all other religions or spiritualities are not just void, but\
    \ its adherents are doomed to hell for eternity. This really put me off: that\
    \ a non-Muslim could live a modest life, live a life dedicated to some sort of\
    \ 'good' in a Platonic sense, can live a life fighting for social justice, fighting\
    \ for those disenfranchised in society but as long as he/she does not adhere to\
    \ Islam, paradise will be denied to them.\n\nThere's a quote, falsely attributed\
    \ to Marcus Aurelius, that asserts a 'just God' would judge man/woman not on his\
    \ religiosity but by the virtues he/she lives by. This really resonates with my\
    \ own belief. I have a hard time conceiving of an all just and all wise God sending\
    \ the world's good non-Muslims to the pits of hell for eternity. What kind of\
    \ gratification does God get from this?\n\nI have also struggled with my sexuality\
    \ - I am a gay man. I use to hate myself for being attracted to the same gender.\
    \ Within the past year or so, I've began a process of finally coming to terms\
    \ with it. So having to hear mainstream Muslims say that same gender love is illegitimate,\
    \ and having to hear that I should 1) remain celibate or 2) marry a woman hurts\
    \ me. I am denied love, a fully intellectual, spiritual, intimate, romantic love,\
    \ while heterosexuals are not. So this is another issue for me. This I feel contradicts\
    \ the 'all just' God. Is it just for heterosexuals to fall in love, share their\
    \ lives together within the confines of a marriage but homosexuals are denied\
    \ it.\n\nMy journey has led me to discover Plato, Rumi, universalism, and deism...\n\
    \nFor me God represents the Forms/virtues Plato alludes to... he is all just,\
    \ all wise etc in every sense of the word and beyond what humans are able to deduce.\
    \ A marriage, a companionship, an association, friendship etc... for me, is a\
    \ dialectic between two people, in refining the 'truths', its aim is virtue, to\
    \ discover what the Good is (or what God is)... it is to move up the ladder...\
    \ outside of the cave. That is its telos.\n\nI don't believe God punishes people\
    \ with earthquakes, floods etc. I do believe that the universe is designed in\
    \ a way reminiscent of the 'karma'. What we release in the world whether good\
    \ or bad, will somehow be reflected back towards the agent.\n\nI do not believe\
    \ that accessing the divine requires any specific religious identity... as long\
    \ as one has an open heart... why should the all loving God, our creator deny\
    \ our call? \n\nI feel like Muslims have such narrow definitions of spirituality\
    \ and God. I feel like I am looked down on as a Muslim if I believe God is more\
    \ accommodating.\n\nI have a hard time accepting that Prophet Mohammad for example\
    \ massacred the Jewish tribe, and took the women as their slaves. Is there mercy?\
    \ The Quran also says a man is allowed to beat his wife 'lightly' as his last\
    \ resort if she remains disobedient. I have a hard time digesting this. Can I\
    \ be a Muslim and believe that the parts of the Quran that may promote some sort\
    \ of violence or inequality amongst men and women, amongst Muslims and non-Muslims\
    \ are obsolete? Can you be a Muslim, a universalist, a humanist simultaneously?\
    \ Please help. Do I even need someone's opinion on this matter? Maybe I should\
    \ be whatever I feel comfortable being..."

    \ not only was there a Jewish dude in Roman Palistine named Jesus, but that he\
    \ was also capable of performing miracles. \n\nWith that said, growing up I was\
    \ an avid reader of The Bible. And one thing that always bugged me because I couldn't\
    \ understand it is why Jesus always wanted to keep his miracles a secret. Almost\
    \ without exception, every time he cured someone he would tell them to keep quiet\
    \ about it. Naturally, according to the accounts in The Bible, they went and blabbed\
    \ about it.\n\nOf course, in the most extreme cases - like cured blindness or\
    \ lame being able to walk - it seems like anyone who knew these people would know\
    \ something was up.\n\nBut what's the rationale? Wouldn't you want everyone to\
    \ know? \n\n--\nEdit: 20140421 - the book Zealot has a very pragmatic reason that\
    \ makes a lot of sense to me. His message (including the healing) was a threat\
    \ to both the priests and the empire. His message was a seditious one. This explanation\
    \ makes sense to me whether Jesus was who Christians (and other religions) think\
    \ he was or whether he was a guy who had some pretty neat ideas."

    study theology and become a religious leaders in the future. However I began to
    wonder a hypothetical "What IF God didn''t exist?" How would my life have been

    So now I''m quite a skeptic of religion and God, but as somebody who wants to
    learn the truth, I must ask the same question: What if God DOES exist? Which is
    what I ask all of you. If God in general exists, how might I have wished I lived
    my life better when I die? (Aside of course following God overall)'

  selftext: 'So I was raised in a bit of a religious sampler pack, and have always
    enjoyed learning about religion and its practices.  But I have consistently lacked
    personal faith throughout my life.  I''ve been doing a lot of thinking about what
    the barriers to personal faith are for me, and I have concluded that my largest
    personal barrier isn''t one I''ve seen cited very often...I think I really stumble
    over the essentialism present in religions.


    To be fair, I''ve never quite understood exactly what essence was supposed to
    be.  But I have found it difficult throughout my life to believe that a characteristic
    or category we attribute to something is somehow derived from a mysterious platonic
    essence.  As a result, I have never really felt like I understood/believed in
    ideas like men having essential attributes which are different from women, or
    the idea that when I see two different chairs and call them both chairs I am referencing
    some ideal concept of "chair".


    Unfortunately, my viewpoint seems to be at odds with pretty much every religion
    I''ve encountered.  Everything from humanity and its actions to God/the gods seem
    to be consistently discussed in terms of their essential characteristics, particularly
    in contemporary religions.  This leaves me wondering, are there any religions
    out there compatible with a non-essentialist viewpoint?'

  selftext: 'Hi,

    I have a girlfriend who''s into New Age stuff (karma, reincarnation, runes, tarot
    cards, astrology, Atlantis, alternative medicine, etc.) as well as inclined towards
    various conspiracy theories. Plus many of her best friends share her beliefs.


    I''ve been interested in the thoughts and theories she believes in, and while
    I straight-out refuse many, there are things I cannot deny but I still can''t
    or don''t want to accept.


    For example, I have no counter-arguments when she tells me that she''s seen various
    ghosts/souls and guardian angels; that she can perceive emotions and "souls" of
    people by simply looking at them; that she has a sixth sense telling her what
    is right and whether something is not; that she can "arrange" things "up there",
    so that things work out the way she needs etc. Unfortunately, many of these have
    turned out to be true (she needs X and X happens shortly; she likes my parents
    but stays alert around them unconsciously, later finds out that they have been
    acting like they like her; she gets a call from a friend giving her advice on
    something she needs at the moment, etc.) I know that anecdotal evidence is not
    evidence, but after a while you start questioning whether coincidences are really
    just coincidences.


    When she tells me that we all are souls constantly being reincarnated and learning
    during our individual physical lives, with the ultimate aim of reaching enlightenment,
    I have nothing to prove she''s wrong. If I ask her to prove her theory, she tells
    me that her past experiences and the way she lives and sees things makes it clear
    to her that these things are real and that I too will one day see things the same
    way.


    I love her very much, even if we disagree in some regards, and I''d be willing
    to accept some of this stuff, but I can''t. I can''t believe something I haven''t
    experienced, although I can''t prove that she''s wrong (and I''m starting to question
    if she is).


    These spiritual topics only come up once in a while, we have a great relationship
    otherwise, but sometimes I really don''t know what to think. And I''d love to
    believe her stuff, because she''s much happier (or just more oblivious?) than
    me thanks to her beliefs, but I don''t know how I could be the same, and whether
    I really want to.


    tl;dr I don''t share my girlfriend''s New Age beliefs, I often run out of counter-arguments,
    I''m open to changing my mind but can''t force myself to do it, any advice?'

  selftext: 'First of all: I guess my following question may offend the one or other
    person on the subreddit, but i ask out of mere interest:

    Why are you religious? This may seem to be a stupid question for religious people
    but I myself have never been religious, have been raised atheistic and none of
    my friends are religious  or just dont express it much. Ive talked to a few religious
    people about this but none of them were able to give a reason for being religious.
    For most of them its just a family tradition they carried on without putting much
    thought into it. That was just a little background so you can get my non-understanding
    (but still accepting and tolerating) view on religion. It would be wonderful if
    you could answer my question, be understanding about my ignorance and provide
    a little background to better understand your introduction and continious belief
    in your religion. :)'

    brought up when they took control of Egypt. Before that it was used by some muslims
    while others did not use it. So my question is why did the Muslim Brotherhood
    want women to wear Hijab? The members of the Brotherhood did not use it themselves
    and I've read several places that the Koran does not say anything about it. Was
    it just a tool to suppress people or did they genuinly belive that the Sharia
    law wanted them to?

    \n\n1. Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you back into unbelievers after\
    \ you have believed, out of envy on their part, after the Truth has become clear\
    \ to them. But pardon and overlook, until Allah brings His command. Allah has\
    \ power over all things.\n\n\nSo, anyone who tries to tell you something different\
    \ you must ignore? How is that not a ploy to control the followers of Islam?\n\

    Rather, the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an idolater.\" \n\n\
    \nThe idea of the trinity is more metaphorical than anything. Because of the omnipresence\
    \ of Yahweh, he can become human even, according to the Bible. Not multiple gods,\
    \ just one. This is where the Quran is wrong about the idea of Yahweh.\n\n3. Your\
    \ God is one God. There is no god but He, the Benevolent, the Compassionate.\n\
    \n\nIf he's so compassionate, why does he threaten to torture you for eternity\
    \ unless you do exactly what he wants?\n\n\n4. Yet among the people are those\
    \ who take other than Allah as equals to Him. They love them as the love of Allah.\
    \ But those who believe have greater love for Allah. If only the wrongdoers would\
    \ realize, when they see the torment; that all power is Allah's, and that Allah\
    \ is severe in punishment.\n\n\nHow does this apply to atheists?"

    drugs heavily. As of now, I am 8 weeks sober. I have been happier and healthier
    since. I have had no psychotic episodes or thoughts or anything of the sort for
    those wondering. But last night, I had just gotten home and out of my car, feeling
    ok but odd in a way, like something was wrong. I was home alone and I went downstairs
    and laid on the couch. Then I felt this unbelievable anger and sadness. I curled
    up in a ball and started to feel like reality was fading almost. I felt my blood
    flow through every one of my veins and it had this weird tingly feeling, and it
    was the most intense thing I have ever felt. I literally could not control my
    body anymore and I lost my sh*t. I was talking in this voice I had never heard
    before, and could not imitate now. It felt inhuman almost. I ended up blacking
    out and splitting open all my knuckles punching this metal thing, and I took scissors
    and gashed a 4 inch cut across my thigh. I was screaming and I could almost hear
    something calling out that it would make me the greatest guitarist ever and give
    me money, fame, and thousands of people that were attracted to me. It just wanted
    me to bleed. I cut myself and said I would give my soul for these things. My reality
    started to fade back in, the tingling eased up, and I laid in the shower for a
    while. My dad got home later, and I was feeling fine. We were talking for a bit,
    and he exclaimed out of nowhere "Look! That''s a solid black butterfly outside!".
    I looked and saw it land in a tree next to my room, and curl up and sleep. Hours
    later, it was still there. I also noticed that after that and today, when playing
    guitar, I was figuring stuff out at an unnaturally fast pace. I also wrote incredible
    riffs and solos compared to normal, and more people are talking to me out of the
    blue. Is this me just hyper focusing due to paranoia or is this legit? For those
    wondering, I am diagnosed with ADHD and general anxiety. I am not bipolar, schizophrenic,
    or anything like that. My mom has anxiety and my dad ADHD, but no other mental
    illnesses run in my family as far as I know. '

    and the remnants of paganism in late antiquity? Finally, in what ways has Sufism
    been instrumental in diverging from the Islamic template? '

  selftext: 'I was over in /r/drugs today and there was a post about people smoking
    cigarettes. One response mentioned they didn''t like cigarettes, but were a fan
    of dokha. A quick google shows me this is a Persian treat that get''s you a little
    high(for lack of a better word). The wikipedia says it causes a "headspin" so
    I guess I am wondering what is different between this "headspin" and actually
    getting high, that makes the dokha allowable?


    My friend once explained to me that in Islam, he was not supposed to cloud his
    mind. This is why drinking and smoking pot would not be allowed, but the stimulant
    in tobacco is okay. If anyone could expand a little on that it would be greatly
    appreciated.


    Cheers.'

  selftext: "I was thinking about Jesus and how he was predicted to arrive in the\
    \ Old Testament. So I decided to look it up. Regarding His birth:\nIsaiah 7:14\
    \ says \u201CTherefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will\
    \ be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.\u201D\
    \n\n\nIsaiah 9:6: \u201CFor to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the\
    \ government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor,\
    \ Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\u201D\n\n\nIn Micah 5:2: \u201C\
    But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out\
    \ of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are\
    \ from of old, from ancient times.\u201D\n\n\nRegarding His ministry and death:\n\
    \n\nZechariah 9:9: \u201CRejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter\
    \ of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle\
    \ and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\u201D\n\n\nPsalm 22:16-18:\
    \ \u201CDogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have\
    \ pierced my hands and my feet. I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat\
    \ over me. They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.\u201D\
    \nLikely the clearest prophecy about Jesus is the entire 53rd chapter of Isaiah.\n\
    \n\nIsaiah 53:3-7 is especially unmistakable: \u201CHe was despised and rejected\
    \ by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men\
    \ hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up\
    \ our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God,\
    \ smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he\
    \ was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon\
    \ him, and by his wounds we are healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray,\
    \ each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity\
    \ of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he\
    \ was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is\
    \ silent, so he did not open his mouth.\u201D\n\n\nThe \u201Cseventy sevens\u201D\
    \ prophecy in Daniel chapter 9 predicted the precise date that Jesus, the Messiah,\
    \ would be \u201Ccut off.\u201D Isaiah 50:6 accurately describes the beating that\
    \ Jesus endured. Zechariah 12:10 predicts the \u201Cpiercing\u201D of the Messiah,\
    \ which occurred after Jesus died on the cross.\n\n\nMany more examples could\
    \ be provided, but these will suffice. The Old Testament most definitely prophesies\
    \ the coming of Jesus as the Messiah.\n\n\nSo my question is: Why then do the\
    \ Jews not believe that Jesus is the Son of God? If they believe that the Old\
    \ Testament is the true word of God, and that word predicted someone who fits\
    \ the description of Jesus of Nazareth, why don't they accept the prophecy as\
    \ truth? If they don't believe that Jesus was the Messiah, are they still waiting\
    \ for this prophecy to come true in the future? And if so, if they didn't believe\
    \ Jesus Christ was the son of God, then what would it take?"

    \ I am just unsure in wither it is the christian god(/other religions god) or\
    \ not.\nThroughout my whole school life I was massively bullied, so much so that\
    \ my adult life has been massively affected due to the mental impact of it during\
    \ my childhood. When I was in secondary school I can safely say i didn't believe\
    \ in God, maybe because I didn't believe that someone who would love me would\
    \ allow me to end up suffering like that, honestly I don't know. \nI thought the\
    \ idea of God and Jesus was stupid and that there was no higher power.\nI remember\
    \ having a discussion with one of my only friends during that difficult time about\
    \ the concept of Jesus and his story and this is where I believe I may have committed\
    \ the unforgivable sin. I believe I said something along the lines of  \"Jesus's\
    \ powers could of been the devil's\" or \"I believe that his power was that of\
    \ the devils\". And at the time I was not aware of the the unforgivable sin (at\
    \ least I don't think I did). Snap to me to In college years where the bullying\
    \ had stopped and I became a lot more happy, I think it was during these times\
    \ I started doubting my atheist beliefs and regained some hope. However it was\
    \ during my second year of college that i learned of the unpardonable sin. This\
    \ is where my worrying started to occur.\nI would like to hope that if there is\
    \ a christian god, that he would accept me if I choose to devote my life to Christianity,\
    \ however I also have this fear that because of what i said he will never accept\
    \ me.\n I also should add that my memory of me saying what I said isn't exactly\
    \ clear, I don't know if I actually said those things or not. I have been reading\
    \ up online and it says that I can only commit this sin if i don't accept Jesus\
    \ as my lord and saviour my whole life. However if I take the passage in the bible\
    \ literally, doesn't that mean I have committed it.\nAm I truly unforgivable?\n\

    \ I find that I agree with certain aspects of many religions, but that I haven't\
    \ found ONE religion that matches all of my beliefs.\nMy main beliefs:\n-If there\
    \ is a god, they (no specific gender, not even necessarily any personification)\
    \ are the embodiment of love\n-That love is like a current running through the\
    \ universe and keeping it going, and it can manifest itself in infinitely many\
    \ ways, such as trees, the change of seasons, pleasure, food, etc.\n-Life is sacred;\
    \ no one life is more valuable than another. Humans are not somehow more important\
    \ than other animals, and it's disrespectful to carelessly harm any life\n-All\
    \ religions are based on the same *something* that we find to be holy, but we\
    \ all see that something through a different lens\n-Reincarnation may be a possibility,\
    \ but not necessarily one way or the other (perhaps if someone leads a very cruel\
    \ life, they will be reincarnated until they get it right. An all-loving deity\
    \ [or love itself] doesn't give you one chance and you're out; they are truly\
    \ all-loving)\nI find it very difficult to come to terms with certain things in\
    \ the Christian bible (the religion under which I was raised), because I don't\
    \ see the Christian representation of God as all-loving. I very much enjoy the\
    \ loving aspect of the Islamic religion, but again, there are instances in which\
    \ my conception of \"all-loving\" does not line up with it. I also prefer the\
    \ Islamic take of bringing glory to their god, rather than the Christian take\
    \ of being guilty and trying to repent. \nI've been extremely drawn to Buddhism\
    \ and Taoism, and just recently discovered the Baha'i religion, but it still doesn't\
    \ quite fit my own thoughts. I find the religions that believe in witchcraft fascinating,\
    \ though I don't think I go to the extent of any of them. My beliefs lie very\
    \ much in nature, but I think every god from every religion is the personification/manifestation\
    \ of whatever our universe hinges on. Any thoughts on religions with which I could\

    /r/CatholicAnswers, /r/Catholicism, /r/AskReligion, and /r/TheAgora.)


    It seems that forms/natures/essences/substances/quiddities all refer to the same
    reality, just under different aspects; form is opposed to matter, nature is the
    source of action, essence is opposed to existence, substance opposed to accidents,
    etc. And it further seems that this reality is what is the subject of a definition,
    consisting of the genus and specific difference.


    Thomas indicates in several places that we can know the forms/natures/essences/substances/quiddities
    of things:


    [Sources](http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/)


    **De Veritate 10.4** (10.5 says much the same) "Thus, the mind knows singulars
    through a certain kind of reflection, as when the mind, in knowing its object,
    which is some universal nature", And "For sense knows these things according to
    their material dispositions and external accidents, but intellect penetrates to
    the intimate nature of the species which is in these individuals."


    **In Boethii Trinitate 6.3** "Now in order to know what anything is, our intellect
    must penetrate its quiddity or essence"


    **Summa Theologiae I.85.5** (ST I.85.6 says much the same) "For the proper object
    of the human intellect is the quiddity of a material thing"


    **Summa Theologiae II-II.8.1** "This is clear to anyone who considers the difference
    between intellect and sense, because sensitive knowledge is concerned with external
    sensible qualities, whereas intellective knowledge penetrates into the very essence
    of a thing, because the object of the intellect is "what a thing is," as stated
    in De Anima iii, 6."


    And indeed this seems to be the basis of the Thomist theory of knowledge, that
    the intellect takes on the forms of all objects upon which it acts, via the phantasms
    abstracted from sensation.


    But Thomas also indicates in several places that we can *not* know the forms/natures/essences/substances/quiddities
    of things:


    **De Veritate 10.1** "Since, however, the essences of things are not known to
    us, and their powers reveal themselves to us through their acts, we often use
    the names of the faculties and powers to denote the essences." And "Since, according
    to the Philosopher, we do not know the substantial differences of things, those
    who make definitions sometimes use accidental differences because they indicate
    or afford knowledge of the essence as the proper effects afford knowledge of a
    cause."


    **In Posteriora Analytica 2.13.10** "But because the essential forms are not known
    to us per se, they must be disclosed through certain accidents which are signs
    of that form, as is stated in Metaphysics VIII."


    **In De Anima 1.1.15** "If indeed the latter could be known and correctly defined
    there would be no need, to define the former; but since the essential principles
    of things are hidden from us we are compelled to make use of accidental differences
    as indications of what is essential."


    **In De Anima 2.2.237** "And because substantial forms, including the forms of
    natural bodies, are not evident to us, Aristotle makes his meaning clear with
    an example taken from the forms (accidental) of artificial."


    **De Spiritualibus Creaturis 11.ad3** "As to the third, it must be said that because
    substantial forms in themselves are unknown but become known to us by their proper
    accidents, substantial differences are frequently taken from accidents instead
    of from the substantial forms which become known through such accidents."


    **Summa Theologiae 1.77.1.ad7** "But because substantial forms, which in themselves
    are unknown to us, are known by their accidents; nothing prevents us from sometimes
    substituting accidents for substantial differences."


    Further, several of the Church Fathers also indicate this inability to know the
    forms/natures/essences/substances/quiddities of things:


    **John of Damascus** ["For the great part the heaven is greater than the earth,
    but we need not investigate the essence of the heaven, for it is quite beyond
    our knowledge."](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf209.iii.iv.ii.vi.html) And
    ["It is evident that both sun and moon and stars are compound and liable to corruption
    according to the laws of their various natures. But of their nature we are ignorant."](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf209.iii.iv.ii.vii.html)


    **Basil the Great** (Against Eunomius I.12-13, available from CUA Press, but not
    online. I have a picture of it from the book on my phone, and can type it out,
    but the argument amounts to that sensation is only of accidental qualities, and
    doesn''t provide knowledge of the inner essence, nor can the rational mind come
    to that essence from the accidents, as the two are not related in a way to allow
    it, specifically addressing the Earth, but in the context of why we can''t know
    the Divine or heavenly essences.)


    **Gregory of Nyssa** ["And as, when looking up to heaven, and in a measure apprehending
    by the visual organs the beauty that is in the height, we doubt not the existence
    of what we see, but if asked what it is, we are unable to define its nature"](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf205.viii.ii.ii.html)
    And, from the same, "For who is there who has arrived at a comprehension of his
    own soul? Who is acquainted with its very essence, whether it is material or immaterial,
    whether it is purely incorporeal, or whether it exhibits anything of a corporeal
    character; how it comes into being, how it is composed, whence it enters into
    the body, how it departs from it, or what means it possesses to unite it to the
    nature of the body; how, being intangible and without form, it is kept within
    its own sphere, what difference exists among its powers, how one and the same
    soul, in its eager curiosity to know the things which are unseen, soars above
    the highest heavens, and again, dragged down by the weight of the body, falls
    back on material passions, anger and fear, pain and pleasure, pity and cruelty,
    hope and memory, cowardice and audacity, friendship and hatred, and all the contraries
    that are produced in the faculties of the soul?" And, from the same, "Wherefore
    also, of the elements of the world, we know only so much by our senses as to enable
    us to receive what they severally supply for our living. But we possess no knowledge
    of their substance, nor do we count it loss to be ignorant of it."


    And from On the Soul and Resurrection: ["We hear the departure of the spirit,
    we see the shell that is left; but of the part that has been separated we are
    ignorant, both as to its nature, and as to the place whither it has fled; for
    neither earth, nor air, nor water, nor any other element can show as residing
    within itself this force that has left the body, at whose withdrawal a corpse
    only remains, ready for dissolution."]


    **John Chrysostom** ["But we do not know what the essence of the sky is. If anyone
    should be confident that he knows its essence and be obstinate in maintaining
    that he has such knowledge, let him tell you what the essence of the sky is."](https://books.google.com/books?id=sJ1ZMYr7NAwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q&f=false)
    And from the same, (Homily V, sometimes visible on Amazon or Google Books in incognito)
    "We do not perfectly know the essence of the angels. Even though we seek to know
    their essence ten thousand times, we cannot discover it. But why do I speak of
    the essence of the angels when we do not even know well the essence of our own
    souls? Rather, we do not have any knowledge whatsoever of that essence."


    And Aquinas (On the Creed, prologue), Basil (Letter 16), and Gregory (Against
    Eunomius 10.1) all reference that we do not veen know the nature of an Ant, in
    giving reason why we cannot know the essence of God.


    I am Orthodox, myself, and therefore a student of Gregory Palamas in the tradition
    of distinguishing Essence and Energies as made clear perhaps first by Gregory
    of Nyssa against Eunomius, and later used in the Ecumenical Councils.


    Given my understanding of this, I take a definition to refer to forms/natures/essences/substances/quiddities
    in the qualified sense that energies correspond to their essences, and therefore
    the propria (energies) of such, combined verbally with the genus. Thus it is only
    by analogy that we would say we "know" essences (by their propria) and "know"
    their propria, as the propria are known directly and indeed in-form the intellect,
    whereas the essences are known only to exist, a kind of pros-hen knowledge of
    being, as we have of God in the Thomist system.


    But if this is so, it seems to undermine the whole Aristotelian-Thomist theory
    of knowledge. And I don''t think I''m the first to encounter this. So does anyone
    have any insight into how to resolve this apparent contradiction?'

    is considered the sustainer of existence. Other things are contingent while God
    is necessary, so the only thing that keeps these things from falling out of existence

    It seems then that hell cannot be complete separation from God, since even hell
    only exists by God''s power. Hell must therefore be some other kind of separation
    from God. The first thing that comes to mind is hell as a fall from grace, but
    I think that describes The Fall as much as hell, so clearly there must be something
    more.

  selftext: I was born in Israel to Israeli-Jewish parents and raised in America.
    I have Jewish-European roots. I was sent to a strict Jewish school, so I got to
    know the religion pretty early. I never had a Bat Mitzva (my parents let me not
    have one). I visited Israel to see my relatives several times. Looks-wise, i don't
    look "Jewish" per se. I just really don't feel as if I fit in. Every Jewish person
    I know, including my own family, seems to be very one-sided on situations concerning
    the religion and et cetera. I've done some research on many traditions, and they
    seem too strict/odd for me to follow. Things I learned at Jewish school and the
    way my family/other Jews behave concerning religion/politics makes me feel like
    I'm surrounded by missionaries, and that I'm being pushed into something I don't
    want to be pushed into. In addition, I've had people attempt to persuade me to
    be on their side (My grandma, for example, tells me things like "There are lots
    of hunks in the Israeli army!") My question here is, even if I wanted to be something
    else (I identify as an Atheist), can I ever really stop being Jewish? It's still
    in my roots, and you can see that I was born in Israel on my birth certificate/passport
    (I have both American and Israeli passports)/whatever and make assumptions about
    me. I want to get rid of those assumptions all together. Is there a way I can
    do this, or am I going to be stuck in the same skin for my whole life, so to speak?

  selftext: I literally just found this subreddit trying to find a sort of "religion
    finder" subreddit and I thought this would be the best place to seek help for
    my problem. So I recently became an atheist after being a long-time Protestant.
    I've also lost a lot of motivation and have become depressed since abandoning
    my former religion. Very recently I've come to the realization that losing my
    religion has created a gap where God used to be, something to motivate me, a purpose.
    Now I still don't believe in a deity so I was wondering if there are any religions
    that do not revolve around a god. I have no idea if this is the right subreddit,
    if it isn't just tell me. But if it is any feedback would be greatly appreciated
    :)

    i have a good size jewish friends and we''ve discussed religion and they''ve never
    referred to the almighty as yahweh.

    here because I was watching the video when it donned on me: If Jesus Christ is
    the son of Elohim and Mary then why is this video showing that Jesus Christ existed
    BEFORE the union of Elohim and Mary (see about 40:00 in)? This got me thinking
    that maybe the argument could be made from the religious side that life is pre-existent,
    as determined by Elohim''s sending the apostles down prior to Jesus Christ ever
    existing here on Earth, in His name!


    Could the concept of our "souls" be a factor in this argument? After all pre-destination
    is a common theme in many religions.


    Of course on the other hand, biology should be a very large factor in deciding
    the answer to this question.

    I loved finding them, since I wanted to able to provide a proper answer to non-believers

    be more chance of them taking the subject seriously rather than me just stuttering
    and trying to make something up based off opinion. However, I couldn't help but
    feel a doubt to these "answers". Some of them pretty much pointed to "Oh because
    God is so loving", others simply felt almost too perfect so that they don't inform
    a lot rather than just provide an answer that really nobody can honestly argue
    since human knowledge is limited, and even some seemed to go against scientific
    fact. Am I the only one who has felt this way? Is there any other answer aside
    from "Oh well God always has the perfect answer"?

  selftext: 'To me, these two things lead to a contradiction when we assume that both
    exist.


    Let me explain:

    If god is all-knowing, then he knows every second of the future.

    Therefore. our future is predetermined.

    Since we cannot influence our future, then, objectively, free will does not exist
    - though we might "feel" like we have one.


    Likewise, if we do have the possibility to influence the future, it means that
    of several possible future outcomes, god doesn''t know which one will actually
    occur. If he doesn''t know something, he is not all-knowing.


    So, whoever believes that both of them can coexist, can you explain how and where
    my conclusions are wrong?


    P.S. If we do not have free will from an objective point of view, it raises other
    questions. Such as: is it fair, to be judged by such an all-knowing entity when
    we aren''t given the chance to influence our future?


    P.P.S. This is my first post. If this question had been more appropriate in a
    different area, pls let me know :)'

    I honestly don''t get this.  If I''m sitting in silence, staring at something,

    his allies and enemies as Devas, ever since it was pointed out to me that the
    bible acknowledges other gods (but simply demands you acquiesce *this one in particular*).
    I''ve rather enjoyed toying with it from a storytelling perspective, wherein Lucifer,
    Beelzebub, etc. are naysayers to Yahweh''s toying with humans. The devas are finite,
    as everything is, so it would even be reasonable to assume that Yahweh, as he
    was, is no longer.


    Additionally, it is a lot of fun to consider Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology
    in much the same way. Scientifically speaking, we still don''t know what''s up
    with a huge chunk of the universe; not, like, in terms of distance, but much of
    the universe, *right here* is completely invisible to us. So if we exist in what
    is, to us, "normal" matter, would it not be possible that maybe there are entities
    in dark matter that have figured out how to interact with us? I don''t know, the
    universe is weird.

  selftext: 'Hi AskReligion.


    I understand the clear link between Christianity and Judaism - Jesus was a Jew,
    hence the two religions are related.

    However, beyond Isaac and Isma''il being brothers, I don''t see how Islam is connected
    with the beliefs and practices of Judaism and Christianity.

    I know, for instance, that Muslims believe Jesus existed as a prophet, but wasn''t
    crucified and wasn''t a Messiah. However, where did Muhammad get this information
    from? I understand Muhammad was raised as a pagan. Unlike Jesus, he didn''t simply
    add to the faith that he was brought up in, he created an entirely different one.
    How did Muhammad''s new faith evolve from the other two if he never practiced
    either?


    Any input would be appreciated.


    TL;DR Muhammad wasn''t a Christian or a Jew, where did he learn about these religions
    and how/why did he incorporate them into Islam?'

    If everything in religion is metaphorical what is it a metaphor for? Can you truly

    and can't be absolutely determined by anyone other than the writer himself. So
    any interpretation is merely an impression of the original writers thoughts and
    therefore not real. So how can we be sure that the religion we are following,
    we are following it the right way.

  selftext: '(Note: I''m a deist, not an atheist, so I''m not trying to bash religions.
    I''m rather trying to understand a concept that religions often hold: an afterlife.)


    This question is (in my opinion) legitimate because **immortality isn''t necessarily
    something I''d value.** Think of a man who knows he has 10 days to live. Would
    he not value every second of his time left all the more greatly? Now imagine that
    same man had an eternity to live? Now that value is depleted. The value we have
    for our lives is partially linked to the fact that it *doesn''t* last forever.
    The same can be said of anything else we value. Finite things > Infinite things.


    This isn''t to say that immortality wouldn''t be cool. But imagine that 10,000th
    year sitting on your cloud thinking "Damn, I wish this would end already!"...which
    leads to my next point: **what exactly does heaven consist of? What does it look
    like, for one, and what is there to do, for two?** If it looks anything like earth,
    then why is its value placed higher than that of...well, earth? How does it transcend
    the grandeur of the natural world? This is important because heaven is supposed
    to be the most beautiful place you could imagine, but the universe and everything
    in it is already pretty damn beautiful (and it doesn''t require dying to witness).


    My final thought on this topic is this: If heaven does exist, I would honestly
    prefer to be given the choice to return to the "worldly" plane whenever I wanted.
    Sort of as a spirit or ghost, if you will. **It seems like being stuck in a realm
    jam-packed with billions upon billions of faithful believers from throughout the
    ages would get claustrophic and possibly irritating.**

    _______________

    TL;DR: **I''d like to hear someone defend the concept of heaven (of any religion)
    and why you think it''s worth seeking after. Thanks in advance!** '

    people say "I''m just being tested" when things in life go wrong. Does God have
    his hand in all things or did he create the universe (specifically mankind) and
    step back letting things progress naturally? I can handle it if the latter is
    the case but if it is the first option then how can something like 9/11 be justified?
    How can God have his hand in something that devastated so many lives and still
    be a benevolent, loving, good creator? If it''s a combination of both- where do

  selftext: Heaven is suppose to be a place where everything is happy and good and
    youre surrounded by your loved ones and the ones you love. My SO does not believe
    in god or heaven or any religion at all, so obviously he wont get to heaven. So
    then how will heaven work out for me if all my loved ones really wont be there?
    how is that going to work in the way that heaven is described? or the people who
    arent clean of sin before they die. will we just be missing all those people in
    heaven? we wont be totally happy w/out them so how does that work?

  selftext: 'I''ve researched and viewed almost all of the churches in my town, but
    none seem to align with my beliefs.


    I believe in a Heaven, but it''s not the streets of gold and mansions with your
    relatives waving at you like you''re at an airport. I believe that your soul gets
    to experience all of the positive emotions like love, happiness, laughter, etc.
    Hell on the other hand is the opposite. It is your soul experiencing all of the
    negative emotions and feelings such as sadness, anger, depression.


    None of the churches I''ve come across believe in that sort of way, and I believe
    from a historical sense that Jesus was here on Earth, and died on the cross because
    he wanted to sacrifice himself for all the sins of mankind.


    Does this sound like any denomination you have heard of? Or could I be something
    like Buddhist? What church would accept my beliefs? I would love to become part
    of a church again. My mother and father are Luthern and I was raised Luthern,
    but now I''m a free thinking person so my views have changed. I feel silly for
    not knowing who I am, so please, if you have any insight, it would be much appreciated.'

  selftext: It's generally assumed that God - being that he's God - is omnipotent,
    omniscient, and omnibenevolent. However, if God is omnibenevolent, it would seem
    that God would always choose the path that does the most good, regardless of his
    thoughts about it. If he's omniscient, then he always knows what that path is,
    and thus has to make every effort to follow it. If he's omnipotent, then there's
    nothing in the way of him following that supremely right path. It seems, therefore,
    that God must not have free will if he is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent.
    I also know, though, that God is generally assumed to have free will. How does
    one reconcile these seeming contradictions?

    He''s also a 33 year old virgin (I don''t know for sure, but I''m pretty sure)

    He''s capable of living on his own, but he doesn''t. He''s an okay looking dude,
    girls could definitely do worse. He''s super frugal with money, hardly ever eats
    out. Whenever I eat out with him, it''s like some amazing experience to him. lol.


    Anyways, just trying to understand him and his religion a little better, he doesn''t
    seem like he wants to talk about it when I ask. He''s never preachy about his

    guys really follow the bible, then why don''t rapist marry the girl they raped?
    From what I''ve seen, most of this was in the old testament and i talked to some
    Christians and they claim that since Jesus died for our sins, we are no longer
    bound by the old testament, but the new testament instead. Then what is the point
    of including the old testament in the bible? Why are there so many contradictions
    in the bible? Why should i even call him god? Is it because of a threat of hell?
    Then he is not a loving god. If god made us and is in control of everything, then
    why does he condemn us to hell for our sins if he knew that we were made that
    way?

    no religion. My family isn't against it, we just don't practice any religion really.
    My dad is an atheist and my mom is more open-minded and generally "christian"
    I guess. It seems like such a crazy decision on deciding what religion is right
    or correct and every christian I know I ask them what they believe. Half of them
    don't even know about christianity, they just practice it because they were raised
    that way! So any information would help thanks guys!

  selftext: 'Hi,


    this may be a bit different, and you may not like my opinion. Just so you know.


    I never was a fan of religion and church, I always thought it''s bullshit and
    it was invented as a reason to start wars and take the money of stupid people.
    This is connected to my mental illness, I am some kind of soziopath. No empathy
    and stuff. Theoretically I could kill someone and minutes later forget about it.
    I''ve been a criminal for longer, destroying stuff, stealing. I was never caught
    though.


    Well, this has been going for long, nothing happened in my life and I did nothing.
    But a few weeks ago I started therapy. Since then my whole life changed, almost
    everything. Instead of electronic music I listen to the darkest kind of metal.
    Instead of a new TV I want clothing, dark clothing. And for no reason at all I
    really wanna find out more about satanism and become a part of it. Instead of
    not caring about anything I start to really feel hate towards so much stuff. Hate
    towards islam because of all the terrorism. Hate towards religious people. Hate
    towards foreigners. And so extremely much hate towards this mess that we call
    earth.


    What I think it that the therapy caused the devil inside me to show himself much
    stronger. On one hand I still thinks this is all bullshit, kind of funny actually.
    On the other hand I really wish it is the devil, because if I would need to decide
    between god and the devil of course I would choose the devil.


    What do you think about this? Maybe I am just bored and have nothing else to think
    about. Maybe there''s more too it. I never believed in god or the devil so I know
    close to nothing about all this.'

  selftext: 'TL;DR Joined the Navy, dating a catholic girl from my old middle school,
    becoming proud of my heritage and wanting something to believe in instead of being
    confused all the time. Help.

    I don''t know how to start this so prepare for a large stream of consciousness
    post.

    As a kid I was never raised in a specific religion as my dad would always switch
    religions and my mom was to busy trying to raise my brother and I alone, divorced
    family, to go to church on Sundays or teach us about God so I just made a silent
    agreement as a little kid with God that I do my stuff and he does his and that
    seemed alright with me. When I got to 6th grade I went to Catholic school and
    they taught me the ways of God under Catholicism and this kind of scared me as
    a 6th grader so I started to question God and became agnostic. When I entered
    high school it was very liberal and basically God became another fictional character
    like the Greek, Egyptian, and Norse gods. Until recently I was a dedicated atheist,
    not Reddit Atheist please don''t compare me to those...jerks, and just lived my
    life in a very drug heavy, rebellious teenage, sex all day and didn''t care about
    school or my parents or future kind of way. But now that I am dating a catholic
    girl, whose not the slut catholic but the catholic catholic, and starting to become
    proud of both my Mexican and Irish heritage and recently joined the Navy i''ve
    started to rethink my stance on religion and become a child of God again. So can
    some nice Catholics out there help me out please, and I don''t want to sound rude,
    but don''t ruin it for me like my school did'
