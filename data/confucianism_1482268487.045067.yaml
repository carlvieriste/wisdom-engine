  - body: 'As 3rd generation Chinese-Indonesian raised with Christianity, I find many
      discrepancies between my parental teachings and the sermons of the pastors.
      When I asked they simply replied "from tradition" and I didn''t know that it
      was Confucianism until I''m in my 20s. My family was heavily christianized from
      a confucian-buddhist base, but it was very apparent as I read the bible that
      so many that I have been taught about life in fact came straight from somewhere
      else, and I later found out that it was the Confucian Classics, nuff said, after
      leaving religions and most philosophies of wisdom in my teens, I now regard
      Confucianism as one of my most prominent moral compasses.


      All being said though, little was done by my family regarding the advices of
      the master. I think this is to be expected since no one after the Qing dynasty
      read the classics for no other than school exams and never take it seriously.
      As I am entering my mid 20s, each passage that I read came to reflect more and
      more accurately to the human condition, such is the strength of the master''s
      observation even though it was done 2500 years ago, and it put me in humility
      of my ancestors'' achievements as my own is just beginning and pales in comparison.'

  selftext: "Hi guys, I'm new to r/Confucianism/ and to reddit in general. To those\
    \ who frequent this subreddit, I'm curious about your background and how you became\
    \ interested in Confucianism. Where I'm from, interest in Confucianism is considered\
    \ quite esoteric. \n\nLet me kick things off. I'm an overseas Chinese who returned\
    \ to mainland China not too long ago. I started reading the *Analects* as a teenager\
    \ because the quotations were short and easy to digest and quickly found that\
    \ they made a lot of sense to me. To this day, I'm most familiar with the pre-Qin\
    \ classics (*Analects*, Mengzi, Xunzi) and some more recent stuff like Jiang Qing's\
    \ book about political Confucianism, which leaves a big 2000+ year gap in between.\
    \ \n\nRight now I'm reading [Choe Bu's](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Bu)\
    \ *Pyeolhaerok* \u6F02\u6D77\u9304, which is just fascinating because it's like\
    \ travelling back in time to the Ming. \n\nWorking and living in China, I can\
    \ see traces of Confucianism around. Filial piety \u5B5D is normative, and most\
    \ people can quote some of the Confucian classics even if they don't know the\
    \ exact source. Having said that, most of the country's Confucian heritage is\
    \ gone and despite government investment in this area, it will be difficult to\
    \ revive it. Most Chinese don't respect learning except material purposes, leaders\
    \ are highly incompetent, and people treat each other horrendously. Maybe it was\
    \ always like this? Maybe not. What I do know is that to call China a \u79AE\u5100\
    \u4E4B\u90A6 would be highly ironic. More like \u5229\u76CA\u4E4B\u90A6!"

  - body: "I too had a very bad taste in my mouth for Confucianism, but after studying\
      \ the classics deeply, I found that I was simply ignorant of actual Confucian\
      \ values and philosophy (just like most other people in East Asia, or so-called\
      \ \"Confucian\" societies). These values have long since been abandoned, but\
      \ the cultural remnants are constantly manipulated to the liking of the times,\
      \ and so people like you and I naturally become averse to Confucianism as embodying\
      \ everything we despise in our current society. \n\nYou have raised a lot of\
      \ very good questions which I hope to include in our FAQs page that is currently\
      \ in progress. I will do my best to help you in your search for understanding\
      \ by addressing the points you have mentioned.\n\n>Confucians are very ritualistic.\n\
      \nThis is certainly the case.  The rites are not arbitrary superstitions (or\
      \ unnecessary rituals)--it is important to distinguish them from such superstitions\
      \ in East Asian culture with which they are often associated. The rites (as\
      \ the practice of propriety [\uF9B6]) are considered to be the substance of\
      \ the Tao of humanity[\u4EBA\u9053], and are therefore the fundamental basis\
      \ of civilization itself. They are not, however, for 'favor from Heaven,' but\
      \ more accurately for the purpose of self-cultivation[\u4FEE\u5DF1], which is\
      \ the process of embodying one's Tao nature. Propriety brings into harmony with\
      \ the *mean* [\u4E2D\u5EB8] every possible human action, and so its educative\
      \ and social value is constantly stressed (though so ironically forgotten in\
      \ today's world!):\n\n>\"Confucius said: 'If the people are led by laws, and\
      \ unification is sought through punishment, they will avoid the punishments\
      \ yet lack a sense of shame. If the people are led by virtue and unification\
      \ is sought through propriety, they will acquire a sense of shame and will become\
      \ good.'\u201D **Analects 2:3**\n>\n\u201CThe rules of propriety serve as instruments\
      \ to form men's characters, and they are therefore prepared on a great scale.\
      \ Being so, the value of them is very high. They remove from a man all perversity,\
      \ and increase what is beautiful in his nature. They make him correct, when\
      \ employed in the ordering of himself; they ensure for him free course, when\
      \ employed towards others. They are to him what their outer coating is to bamboos,\
      \ and what its heart is to a pine or cypress. These two are the best of all\
      \ the productions of the (vegetable) world. They endure through all the four\
      \ seasons, without altering a branch or changing a leaf. The superior man observes\
      \ these rules of propriety, so that all in a wider circle are harmonious with\
      \ him, and those in his narrower circle have no dis-satisfactions with him.\
      \ Men acknowledge and are affected by his goodness, and spirits enjoy his virtue.\u201D\
      \ **Classic of Rites, Li Qi:1**\n>\n\u201CThey are the rules of propriety, that\
      \ furnish the means of determining (observances) relatives, as near and remote;\
      \ of settling points which may cause suspicion or doubt; of distinguishing where\
      \ there should be agreement, and where difference; and of making clear what\
      \ is right and what is wrong.\u201D **Classic of Rites, Qu Li I:6**\n\nTo answer\
      \ your second question in the same breath, the rites were the core of Confucian\
      \ principles of government and civility. \"The state is the basis of all under\
      \ heaven, the family is the basis of the state, self-cultivation is the basis\
      \ of the family.\" In other words, more than the enforcement of laws, a proper\
      \ government simply upholds the rites--that is, the law of the land was found\
      \ in the virtues of self-cultivation. In this sense, it is difficult to say\
      \ that Confucianism was authoritarian. Such a notion suggests that the king\
      \ is an infallible dictator, but this is not the case. It is the job of the\
      \ king to strive for the greatness of the ancient sage kings, meaning, he is\
      \ expected to exemplify perfect human virtue. Additionally, he is guided by\
      \ a cabinet of ministers. As you might recall from the Five Relationships, *between\
      \ ruler and minister there is righteousness*. This means that they are mutually\
      \ obligated to be loyal to what is right. Historically, these values have not\
      \ been upheld, of course. Confucius himself traveled the land seeking an audience\
      \ with a ruler who would hear what he had to say. Needless to say, he thought\
      \ very poorly of the leadership of his times. There have been many complications,\
      \ reinterpretations, and alterations of the Confucian ideas of government over\
      \ the years.\n\nConfucianism did recognize hierarchy in society. But this is\
      \ not a caste system, and Confucian moral sentiment places absolutely no value\
      \ on notions of economic superiority or status. de Bary describes ideal Confucian\
      \ society as having \"an egalitarian spirit, based on the equal provision of\
      \ the means of subsistence for all and the principle of mutual aid, yet there\
      \ is also a division of function between a governing or leadership elite and\
      \ commoners who provide the means of subsistence.\" He is referring to the well-field\
      \ system which Mencius is famous for advocating in his times. Of course, it\
      \ is clear how this system has been manipulated all throughout history, but\
      \ again, it is important to distinguish Confucian values and philosophy from\
      \ Chinese history and culture.\n\nFilial piety is a another aspect of Confucianism\
      \ which has become problematic modern East Asian society which take a great\
      \ deal of liberty in its interpretation. The virtue of filial piety is commonly\
      \ used to legitimize authority like you said, but this isn't the point of filial\
      \ piety as it was conceived in Confucian literature. In a conversation with\
      \ Duke Ai, Confucius explained filial piety as such:\n\n>\"Anciently, under\
      \ the government of the intelligent kings of the three dynasties, it was required\
      \ of a man to show respect to his wife and son. When the path (of right government)\
      \ was pursued, the wife was the hostess of the (deceased) parents - could any\
      \ husband dare not to show her respect? And the son was the descendant of those\
      \ parents - could any father dare not to show him respect? The superior man's\
      \ respect is universal. Wherein it appears the greatest is in his respect for\
      \ himself. He is in his person a branch from his parents - can any son but have\
      \ this self-respect? If he is not able to respect his own person, he is wounding\
      \ his parents. If he wound his parents, he is wounding his own root; and when\
      \ the root is wounded, the branches will follow it in its dying. These three\
      \ things are an image of what is true with the whole people (in the body politic).\
      \ One's own person reaches to the persons of others; one's own son to the sons\
      \ of others; one's own wife to the wives of others. If a ruler do these things,\
      \ the spirit of his conduct will reach to all under the sky. If the course of\
      \ the great king be thus, all the states and families will be docilely obedient\"\
      \ **Classic of Rites, Ai Gong Wen: 8**\n\nAnd again in response to Zi You in\
      \ the Analects: \n\n>Zi You asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"\
      The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses\
      \ likewise are able to do something in the way of support\u2013without reverence,\
      \ what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other? **Analects\
      \ 2:7**\n"

  - body: "\nFilial piety is not the simple obedience of the will of one's parents,\
      \ but it is part of the practice of human virtue, of the process of 'self-cultivation,'\
      \ and the embodiment of the Tao nature. Furthermore, the practice of 'affection'\
      \ between parent and child is necessarily mutual--in fact, reciprocation is\
      \ the very core of all the Five Relationships (as was the case with the ruler-minister\
      \ relationship mentioned earlier). The notion in East Asia that elders should\
      \ be obeyed no matter what is the not a Confucian sentiment, but is simply an\
      \ appeal to 'tradition' for the purpose of legitimizing authority. This isn't\
      \ a phenomenon exclusive to modern society, but particularly since the abandonment\
      \ of Confucian education Confucian ideals, philosophy, and traditions have been\
      \ continually distorted and misinterpreted in the process of modernization.\n\
      \n>Confucianism forces people to be educated.\n\nI don't know that this is true\
      \ of the past any more than it is today. As I pointed out earlier, government\
      \ and society in general need education to function properly. Indeed Confucianism\
      \ traditionally insisted on universal education, for learning is central to\
      \ Confucian philosophy, and perhaps the most salient aspect of it. The very\
      \ basic concept of learning, of self-cultivation, is not separate from that\
      \ of education others. There is the famous saying in the Analects that the practice\
      \ of *jen*[\u4EC1], or perfectly humane virtue, is a matter of standing oneself\
      \ up while simultaneously helping others to stand also. This is the Way of Humanity.\
      \ One does not become an enlightened sage and simply take to a hermitage in\
      \ the woods, but rather Confucians found the realization of one's Tao nature\
      \ to necessarily proceed in the assisting of others to do the same. \n\n>What\
      \ would Kong Fu Zi have to say about torturing one's offspring for a better\
      \ grade?\n\nHe would have much to say about the state of education in Asia currently.\
      \ Grades, jobs, exams, status, money, etc. are certainly not the point of learning\
      \ in the Confucian sense, although, Confucianism is often blamed for the rigorous\
      \ educational climate of Asia today. There are a few things to realize about\
      \ this situation though. Firstly, the famous public exams which are often blamed\
      \ as the root of educational problems in contemporary society, were the result\
      \ of reforms for which Chu Hsi [\u6731\u71B9](1130-1200) is largely responsible.\
      \ Chu Hsi revived Confucian education, as it had become simply a mechanical\
      \ matter of memorizing the classic texts--the values and philosophy of which\
      \ were not put into practice. Chu Hsi saw the problems of his day to be rooted\
      \ in this lack of actual 'self-cultivation,' and aimed to rectify the political,\
      \ social, educational, and economic reality of his time through reforms. These\
      \ exams were a way to ensure that those put into office were only those who\
      \ truly understood and lived the philosophy of the classics which were at the\
      \ focus of the exams and Confucian education. They were not simply a test of\
      \ one's knowledge, but more so one's character, and furthermore the education\
      \ system was not merely for the preparation of these exams. This is perhaps\
      \ the most common misunderstanding of Confucian education during this era, and\
      \ is simply a projection of current problems onto the past. The second point\
      \ to note about Confucian education (as envisioned by Chu Hsi), is that in addition\
      \ to providing people with skills valuable to their trades, it was intended\
      \ as a means for equipping even the common folk with the means to access and\
      \ participate in culture, which has historically been dominated by the literari\
      \ and upper class. This is seen as essential for society to work properly. It\
      \ is common sense that if society is not educated, then people are easily deceived\
      \ by those with authority. \n\nThe educational situation of East Asia today\
      \ cannot be wholly attributed to traditional Confucian education. Not only are\
      \ Confucian values starkly contrasting with those of today, the Confucian academic\
      \ tradition has long been abandoned. Certainly, there are cultural phenomena\
      \ that have their roots in former-Confucian society, but the motivational factors\
      \ for the current education system are undoubtedly not Confucian in origin,\
      \ philosophically speaking, that is. The advent of modernization can be understood\
      \ as the catylizing element in the development of the fiercely competitive education\
      \ we have today. Of course, the past was not without conflict, but again, it\
      \ is important to distinguish Confucian values and philosophy from the culture\
      \ and history of East Asia and the events that transpired during the time when\
      \ Confucian traditions were actively transmitted. The problem was then as it\
      \ is now--that is, wholesome understanding and practice of virtue is decidedly\
      \ a challenging task.\n\n>Confucianism is backwards, and is unconcerned with\
      \ the economy...All because Kong Fu Zi did not trust merchants.\n\nI don't know\
      \ what you are referring to exactly. How did Confucius not trust merchants?\
      \ I cannot think of an instance when Confucius expressed explicit distrust or\
      \ condemnation for merchants. Furthermore, it seems rather radical to say that\
      \ Confucianism is unconcerned with the economy. The ancient texts are chalk\
      \ full of detailed explanations as to the proper methods of farming and crafting.\
      \ At any rate, the political events of China and other East Asian cannot be\
      \ taken as wholly demonstrative of Confucian values and philosophy. That would\
      \ be like saying the corruption in Thai government demonstrates Buddhist values,\
      \ or the extremist governments in the Middle East demonstrate Islamic values.\
      \ If anything, history shows us our successes and failures in the practice of\
      \ virtue, if seen through Confucian eyes, that is.\n\nI hope that these few\
      \ points I was able to make in regard to your questions are helpful. I am not\
      \ sure I was able to articulate myself well enough, but hopefully what I have\
      \ written is sufficient for discussion. (And sorry that it is so long!)"

    \ carries on rituals, daughters are usually aborted or mistreated in rural parts\
    \ of Mainland China.\n\n 3. Confucianism forces people to be educated - Confucianism\
    \ emphasizes the ancient system of royal/Imperial examinations. As society tended\
    \ to be rigid in ancient times, well-off parents would spend almost everything\
    \ they could have to send their children to examination halls, where the students\
    \ could even overwork just to get a better job in the king or Emperor's palace.\n\
    \nThis may be the origin of the vicious stereotype of us Asians forcing our children\
    \ to study and work from an early age, without any leisure or rest, exploding\
    \ into anger or giving them harsh punishments for even a lesser grade (if not\
    \ any failure). What would Kong Fu Zi have to say about torturing one's offspring\
    \ for a better grade?\n\n 4. Confucianism is backwards, and is unconcerned with\
    \ the economy - Look at the very officials who stopped Zheng He and his expensive\
    \ voyages out into the world. Because of people like these Confucians, Ming China\
    \ regressed into backwardsness, allowing other powers like the Manchus, Westerners,\
    \ and Japanese to bully them in the centuries after.\n\nAll because Kong Fu Zi\
    \ did not trust merchants. As a result, China and other societies (like Korea\
    \ and Japan) had merchants as the lowest class, lower than farmers. Whereas in\
    \ other societies, merchants had greater influence in public life.\n\nCan any\
    \ of you correct these misunderstandings of mine? They are why I sometimes despised\
    \ Confucianism, and had stereotypes attacking Confucians and my native Chinese\
    \ culture."

  - body: "Hi!  I am quite late to this study group, but I think there will be little\
      \ harm done if I share a few notes on the Western Inscription before this thread\
      \ is archived.  *If I have made any errors in understanding, please correct\
      \ me!*  \n\n\n\nI think the *Diagram of the Western Inscription* is a very important,\
      \ profound work.  By stressing humanity's common origin in Ch'ien (Heaven, yang;\
      \ the Creative Principle) and K'un (Earth, yin; the Passive Principle), Zhang\
      \ Zai is able to construct a beautiful answer to the metaphysical challenges\
      \ provided by Daoist and Buddhist philosophers.  The Western Inscription is\
      \ the culmination of a millenium of metaphysical development in Confucianism,\
      \ and sparked the beginnings of Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucian renaissance.  \n\n\n\n\
      The main statement of the Western Inscription seems to be: *\"Principle is one,\
      \ but its manifestations are diverse.\"*  Unity of Principle means that since\
      \ All Things are produced by Heaven and Earth, we should remember that all living\
      \ creatures share a common birth.  (*\"All people are from the same womb as\
      \ I; All creatures are my companions.\"*)  Zhang Zai wants us to understand\
      \ that humanity forms an extended family; a *single body*.  \"Diverse manifestations\"\
      \ is a reminder of direct experience of society; that is, it is perfectly natural\
      \ to prioritize one's love.  This is an admonishment to Mozi's *impartial caring*,\
      \ which promotes an egalitarian love without regards to family or status.  Zhang\
      \ Zai teaches us that the best way to serve Heaven and Earth, our cosmic parents,\
      \ is to first serve our physical, earthly parents.  We cannot understand ourselves\
      \ as isolated beings; we are a product of our parents, who are products of their\
      \ family lines, which are ultimately products of Heaven and Earth.  So, although\
      \ we prioritize those closest to us, it is also crucial that we remain aware\
      \ of our duty to the single body of humanity.  Thus, the Confucian doctrines\
      \ of filial piety and *ren* find their metaphysical basis in the Western Inscription.\n\
      \n\n\n*\"The disposition of commiseration is the beginning of humanity.\" \u2014\
      Mengzi*\n\nThe foundation of humanity (*ren*) is compassion and concern.  No\
      \ one may became a sage without these virtues.  The Superior Man understands\
      \ the nature of reality and acts in accordance with the Supreme Ultimate.  Perceiving\
      \ our common origin in Ch'ien and K'un, and playing his role in the single body\
      \ of humanity, it would be impossible for a sage to act out of selfishness.\
      \  Vigilant in peace and stoic amidst chaos, the Superior Man regards his neighbors'\
      \ success and misfortune as his own.  Realizing the unity of principle encompassing\
      \ diverse manifestations, how can one do evil unto another?  This is why the\
      \ Western Inscription contains the substance of *ren*."

    \n-------------------------\n\n*The Western Inscription is the work of Chang Tsai\
    \ (1020-1077), and it stands with the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate as one of\
    \ the most fundamental documents of the Neo-Confucian tradition. It puts flesh\
    \ and blood on the bare bones of metaphysics, reflecting upon Heaven and Earth\
    \ as the common parents of all creatures; stemming from a single common origin,\
    \ all of creation is therefore a single body, and all people form a single great\
    \ family. With the Western Inscription the level of discourse shifts from metaphysics\
    \ to ethics: granted this unity which pervades the cosmos, what does it mean for\
    \ the way I relate to others? How should I live, and how should I die?*\n\n-------------------------\n\

      At the core you have:


      *Great Learning* - Chapter from *The Book of Rites*, small Confucius section
      with 9 commentary sections from his disciple, Zengzi.


      *Doctrine of the Mean* - written by the grandson of Confucius and adopted into
      the c


      *Analects* - pure Confucianism, every word supposedly taken from the works of
      his disciples. It''s very important to get a good commentary on this text. Lau
      is the traditional version and Dawson is generally picked as the next best.
      There''s also a fantastic commentary from Neo-Confucianist Zhu Xi translated
      by Daniel Gardner.


      *Mencius* - A later scholar, who learned from Zengzi. He had a slightly different
      take on things. A must read if you want to study the evolution of Confucianism
      through the ages.


      In addition I would add my former professor''s work:

      [Utilitarian Confucianism: Ch''en Liang''s Challenge to Chu Hsi](http://www.amazon.com/Utilitarian-Confucianism-Challenge-Harvard-Monographs/dp/0674931769)
      if you want to see the conflicts and divisions in Confucian thought.'

    \ his translated text of T'oegye's *Ten Diagrams of Sage Learning*. It explains\

    ##The Sung Dynasty Neo-Confucian Revival\n* Why did Confucius emphasize the importance\
    \ of *moral learning*?\n* How are Classical Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism\
    \ different or alike?\n* Who was Chu Hsi and what was his role in developing Neo-Confucianism?\n\
    * How did the advent of Neo-Confucianism affect the so-called Confucian canon?\
    \ Is Neo-Confucianism best described as a division from or an evolution of Classical\
    \ Confucianism?\n\n##The Late Koryo-Early Yi Transition Period\n* How was Neo-Confucianism\
    \ first established in Korea? \n* How did Neo-Confucianism in Korea contribute\
    \ to the rise of the Yi Dynasty? What effect did this have on Korean schools of\
    \ thought in relation to those in China?\n\n##Rise of the Sarim Mentality and\
    \ the Literary Purges\n* What are the values of the Sarim and under what conditions\
    \ did it emerge?\n* In what ways can Cho Kwangjo's rise to political power be\
    \ seen as a triumph or a catastrophe for the Sarim movement?\n* How did the Sarim\
    \ mentality finally become accepted as orthodox in Korea?\n\n##Yi Hwang (T'oegye,\
    \ 1501-1570)\n* How did T'oegye's upbringing contribute to his lifelong dedication\
    \ to learning?\n* In what ways did the climate of official Korea during the time\
    \ of T'oegye's life cause him to go more or less unnoticed? \n* What were the\
    \ contributing factors that urged T'oegye to retire from office?\n* Why did T'oegye\
    \ write the *Ten Diagrams of Sage Learning*?\n\n##T'oegye's Learning\n* How did\
    \ T'oegye educate himself in the Neo-Confucian tradition despite limited access\
    \ to literature or intellectual discourse?\n* What is the *Classic of the Mind-and-Heart*,\
    \ and how did it affect T'oegye and consequently Neo-Confucianism in Korea?\n\
    * Why is T'oegye known as the \"synthesizer and complete integrator\" of the Ch'eng\
    \ Chu school in Korea? \n\n##The Ten Diagrams\n* Why are the *Ten Diagrams* the\
    \ most popular of T'oegye's work?\n* What in particular makes the *Ten Diagrams*\
    \ so effective in explaining Neo-Confucian principles?\n* What is the central\
    \ theme of the *Ten Diagrams* and how are they arranged to support this concept?\n\
    \n##Supplementary Discussion\n* What implications could T'oegye's *Ten Diagrams*\
    \ have on education today?\n* Are Neo-Confucian values reflected in modern Korean\
    \ and/or Chinese society?\n"

      \ comparatively demonstrates a setback in how we came to evolve in the West,\
      \ where we took our mighty time ensuring citizens can know the law and predicting\
      \ their actions.\n\nThen Confucianism seems to have a core ideology that i)\
      \ spread to influence many other philosophies, that ii) was connected with Legalism\
      \ itself to enforce the Emperors power, but more importantly, ii) is perceived\
      \ more as an ethical system, rather than a religion.\n\nIt is in this last point\
      \ that I believe the appeal of Confucianism lies; \nSince Nietzsche that we\
      \ no longer have god to tell us what is the proper, moral, way to live.\nConfucianism\
      \ has the potential of filling this gap, since we are mostly disconnected of\
      \ our own Western Ascestry; for example, when we try to admire Aristotles, he\
      \ just won't quit mentioning the gods as an argument, and women in an unfavorable\
      \ light, whereas the purist versions of Confucianism don't undermine women,\
      \ and seem to me less likely to clash with modern conceptions of the womans\
      \ role in society (although feminism isn't something I'm versed in, at all).\n\
      \nLike when it was adapted to Legalism, Buddism, etc., Confucianism in all likelyness\
      \ can be adapted to meet out modern conceptions of society.\nIt has the advantage\
      \ of being already present among us, in philosophies we already hold i); it\
      \ has the adaptability required to update itself ii); and won't clash with the\
      \ western laic societies.\n\n\nSo the revival of this subreddit can be tied\
      \ to this; a project to bring Confucianism to the current age, and to the West.\n\
      \nIt would not meet resistance by the atheists, which can be the primary interested\
      \ group in it, due to the lack of an established ethical system among them.\n\
      (I would give in that Christianism has established morals that remain being\
      \ followed for the most part, in spite of the rejection of the worship; but\
      \ I also see aspects of Confucianism in Christianism itself, which means, again,\
      \ that we can use the Confucianism already existing, and without the unattractive\
      \ aspects of Christianism.)\n\n**TL;DR**: Confucianism being laic, maleable,\
      \ and already present makes it applicable in modern western societies, with\
      \ the atheists as the main group interested thanks to the absence of an established\
      \ ethical/moral system in Atheism."

  selftext: Hello. I took a class on Confucian literature last semester and was interested
    in getting some of the classics I've read onto my Kindle, although it's not something
    I can really afford to spend money on. I have physical copies of The Analects
    (Leys), Mencius (Lau), and Xunzi (Watson). As you can imagine, the e-books all
    cost money. Do you know of some similarly decent translations that I can find
    for free? Also, if you have any other ideas for Confucian literature, I'd be happy
    to hear it.

      Morals\")? The relationships and their corresponding virtues varied between\
      \ the early texts. The *Zuo Commentary* and *Shiji* explain them not as relationships\
      \ but as roles, in which there is no mention of friends, but only that of older\
      \ brother(\u5144) and younger brother (\u5F1F). The *Doctrine of the Mean* includes\
      \ these roles as a relationship expressed as \u6606\u5F1F in addition to the\
      \ typical friend-friend relationship expressed as \u670B\u53CB. The canonical\

      \ that of older-and-younger-brother for the more general relationship of elder-younger.\
      \ Additionally, there are countless times in the old writings especially when\
      \ \"friendship\"or \"friendliness\" is used in contexts concerning students\
      \ and teachers or juniors and seniors, so the actual content of a \"friendship\"\

    \n-------------------------\n\n*This is the last of the three chapters the Ten\

    \ and Great Learning described the continuity of the learning process from youth\
    \ to adulthood; they showed how from beginning to end it is a twofold process\
    \ of study and practice and emphasized the role of mindfulness as its central\
    \ methodology. The Five Relationships occupy a central place in the Ele\xADmentary\
    \ Learning, while the investigation of principle and the steps of practical self-cultivation\
    \ and its expansion to include all of society are de\xADveloped in the Great Learning.\
    \ This chapter uses the rules Chu Hsi es\xADtablished for the White Deer Hollow\
    \ Academy to show the structural integration of these themes: as presented here,\
    \ the Five Relationships are not only the foundation, but the sum and substance\
    \ of all learning, the object toward which all study and practice are ultimately\
    \ devoted.*\n\n-------------------------\n\nEnglish Versions (courtesy of Dr.\

  selftext: 'One of my favourite lines from any philosopher comes from Confucius:


    "''The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name."


    It took me a while to realize the depth of this observation.  What does he mean?  Should
    I read the dictionary more often?  What I take him to mean is that we sometimes
    come up with more than one word to describe the same thing, and this can be lead
    us in to a lot of trouble if we''re not careful.  An example might be something
    like "collateral damage" - this word is especially pernicious when it is used
    to describe people.  Imagine if every politician instead of describing the killing
    of innocent civilians as "collateral damage" was compelled to describe it as "strategic
    murder".  Words can be used to obscure as much as clarify, unless we do as Confucius
    suggests and cultivate the wisdom of calling a duck a duck.

      \ that time Confucianism transcended its mundane place as just a means of government\
      \ and matured as a philosophy through the discourse between Korean and Chinese\
      \ scholars as well.\n\nYou might look into the Yaojiang School also. It was\
      \ sort of started by Wang Yang Ming during the Ming Dynasty, but it sustained\
      \ its influence into the Qing Dynasty, particularly the civil service exams.\
      \ The Lu-Wang School and the Ch'eng-Chu School also. Though these have their\
      \ origin in pre-Qing times, their effect was huge later, and became the basis\
      \ for a lot of social reform during the Qing. The same is true in Korea and\
      \ Japan--the time was marked as a transitional phase where people started to\
      \ look at Confucianism from a more spiritual but also critical standpoint, which\
      \ became pretty bloody.\n\n[This website](http://ctext.org/qing) has some texts\
      \ from the Qing Dynasty that might be interesting to you and what you are trying\
      \ to research. Many of them are not in English, though there are a few with\
      \ some translations. \n\nIf you are looking for non-primary sources, read some\

      \ his books to pull out particular sections pertaining to what you are studying\

  - body: 'It is a very debatable topic, but my position is that Confucianism (and
      neo-Confucianism)  never sought absolute truth, and certainly their worldview
      and cosmology is absent of such a concept. The Tao, or li as neo-Confucians
      described it, is not a static, more essential reality external to the world
      that it generates and orders.  It itself is indeterminate not simply because
      it is the source, but because it too is constantly in flux as it transforms
      in each novel instantiation of the things and events it gives rise to. The Confucian
      sage is not one who possesses knowledge of some absolute truth, but rather,
      he is one who is able to discover anew the Way emergent in every moment. This
      is why Chinese philosophies have historically appealed to actual experience
      and exemplary character as the primary means for justifying their claims. Indeed,
      thinkers of East Asia were not measured by their knowledgeability, but more
      so by their character--how much they actually lived and embodied what it was
      they attended to intellectually. The point that they did not seek absolute truth
      is further demonstrated by the fact that in Confucianism, knowing is inextricable
      from action precisely because knowing something isn''t to possess the fact,
      but being able to enunciate it (or make it real) in one''s actual interactions
      (whether that be with people, objects, ideas, feelings, etc. ). This is a very
      condensed response, but I hope it serves as food for thought. I''d be happy
      to elaborate on these points if I get a moment. '

  - body: "I'm curious what you mean by genuine knowledge. Confucianism and Daoism\
      \ importantly differ from philosophical traditions of the West on the point\
      \ that they do not privilege knowledge or language in and of themselves--that\
      \ is to say, truth in Chinese philosophy is not \"rational\" or \"static\" in\
      \ any way. Such schools of thought in China died out early on. What is \"true\"\
      \ or \"genuine\" in Confucianism is not justified logically, but experientially.\
      \ All the teachings of Confucianism require its learners to actually do and\
      \ live the things it speaks of in order to confirm them. The \"superior person\"\
      \ is not one who sees the more real world or has access to more real knowledge,\
      \ but he is one who exemplifies in his actions the virtues of a \"Way-seeking\"\
      \ human. In this way, \"exemplary person\" is a more appropriate interpretation\
      \ of \u541B\u5B50 than \"superior person.\" In fact, the most important figures\
      \ in Confucian history are remembered not because of their novel, sophisticated\
      \ or unique ideas, but because they embodied \"the Way\" in their thoughts and\
      \ actions, and as such became exemplars for the rest to follow. This is a crude\
      \ summary, but it is good food for thought. \n\nI always recommend that people\
      \ read [I Hwang](http://faculty.washington.edu/mkalton/10dia%20contents%20web.htm)\
      \ because his work is the culmination of a life dedicated to sagely study as\

      \ thought. Kalton's translation is excellent, and his commentary informs the\
      \ reader of important themes and connections in the text. If you want to know\
      \ how to become an exemplary person in the Confucian sense, then these diagrams\

    Looking to buy Mencius in paperback and having choosing between the 1. [D. C.
    Lau translation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014044971X/) or 2. [David Hinton
    translation](http://www.amazon.com/Mencius-David-Hinton/dp/1619025558/). I don''t
    really know a lot about either of these editions, but the Lau edition does appear
    to be much more popular (32 reviews vs 4).


    If anyone has read either and/or could make a suggestion, I''d appreciate it.

  - body: "This is an interesting question, and might be hard to get at just through\
      \ a simple answer. One thing I would suggest is to read the other Confucian\
      \ classics, because they all reference The Analects, but do so to expand upon\
      \ them and frame them in refined contexts you could say. As time went on, people\
      \ began to ask the same questions you are and interpreted Confucius to elaborate\
      \ on them. Perhaps you are more concerned about the thoughts of Confucius specifically,\
      \ though.\n\nIt could be said that the search for truth is central to what Confucius\
      \ taught. He was an educator, and believed that society should reflect the Tao\
      \ (the ultimate truth) as manifest in human virtues (which he explained within\
      \ the cultural context of his time), and that genuine learning proceeded from\
      \ this practice. The sage is often referred to as one who completely abides\
      \ the Tao, but is not so because he is somehow different, rather he exemplifies\
      \ the complete embodiment of human virtue. Some scholars say that the emphasis\
      \ put on practicing virtue was essential in the times and specific to Confucius'\
      \ goal as an educator. \n\nAnother thing to consider about Confucian notions\
      \ of truth, is that truth is believed to be realized through intuition and contemplation--that\
      \ is, we exist as part of the Tao and thus have direct access to it, however,\
      \ any explanation of the Tao and its workings serves us only in so far as it\
      \ simply points our attention to it to be conceived by us directly. I believe\
      \ this is why Confucius emphasized practicing virtue as opposed to making extensive\
      \ arguments about 'what' that truth is, because through practice harmonious\
      \ with the Tao one can realize it for themselves.\n\nLet's keep this discussion\
      \ rolling! This is good stuff!"

  - body: 'My reply in the other thread:


      What must be clarified first is what does ''truth'' mean in this case? The nature
      of reality? To know all facts? An external truth? This is often spoken of in
      Western philosophy ("to seek truth") but that proposition by its nature is vague,
      as it implies something, which is not defined, is lacking.


      Study is of great importance to Master Kong, as we can see in the first verse
      of the Analects:


      "To study and then practice what has been learned, is that not a pleasure in
      and of itself? If a friend from far away comes to visit you, is that not happiness
      itself? If people do not know of you, yet you are not concerned with this, are
      you not still a great man?"


      This verse hinges on its last point, the goal, to become a great man, and that
      in itself is the truth that should be sought. If you enjoy philosophy for its
      own sake, haven''t you already found happiness? There is something deep in this
      simplicity, which is, as you have noted, also very practical.


      So, in what ways do you think his philosophy considers "the search for truth"
      as "unimportant"?

  selftext: The Analects are centrally concerned with the nature of human happiness,
    the relation of the individual to the state, and the ideal for humans. Western
    philosophers regard these issues as centrally concerned with the search for truth.
    This search for truth receives no mention in the Analects, nor is there any developed
    epistemology aimed at securing truth as a goal. Why does this search for truth
    apparently play no role for Confucius? What is it about his philosophy that makes
    the search for truth so unimportant?

  - body: Sure, I'd like to collaborate. I developed a deep appreciation of Confucian-influenced
      culture after living in South Korea for over five years and marrying a Korean.
      I am interested in all Eastern philosophies, but I was particularly struck by
      the seolnal filial ceremony, after which I really began to identify with my
      Korean family. There is what I think of as a decentralized ego among Koreans,
      where "I" includes one's family. This is a fundamental shift in thinking with
      many corresponding effects, like feeling more secure and less alienated than
      I've ever felt in my life. I also think the orientation towards one's ancestors
      is mind-opening when experienced. I think there is a tendency in America to
      focus on oneself and one's progeny at the expense of the elders, and I wonder
      if that isn't a mistake. I also think it interesting how intertwined various
      East Asian philosophy/religions are. I am currently a seon Buddhist, but many
      of our practices are filial, shamanic, etc. My impression is that filiality
      did begin with Confucius, but was harnessed from a much older Eastern system
      of thought, which I think is fascinating. I feel like you probably have a lot
      more knowledge of Confucianism than I do, but I do have some lived experience
      and several books on Eastern philosophy, so I hope to spread the word. One thing
      I am personally dying to know are the Confucian rituals in detail. Besides just
      reading about Confucianism, I'd love to be able to actually practice it.

      \ our mother, and our father, the sky). But the author again misinterprets these\
      \ concepts as being mundane rules or expectations within idealistic *Confucian*\
      \ society:\n\n>In order to understand specific familial and social duties, \u7FA9\
      , we need to near at hand to those we should be closest to.  I can't really\
      \ know what my mother or father or sister or brother might require of me if\
      \ I am a thousand miles away distracted by work and other entanglements. \n\n\
      Besides the fact that the author defined familial and social duties as \u7FA9\
      \ (righteousness) instead of \u5B5D (Hyo), he demonstrates his misunderstanding\
      \ of Hyo by stating that it is necessary to be near one's family in order for\
      \ Hyo to be practiced. Shouldn't sincere admiration and respect for one's family\
      \ precede the expression of such? What of the orphan? What of the many scholars\
      \ who traveled to far away lands for diplomacy and study? What of the many adolescents\
      \ who boarded in academies for the majority of their young lives? It is obvious\
      \ then, that Hyo is not contingent on proximity to one's kin, but rather more\
      \ profoundly denotes reverence for creation--in terms of society, of course,\
      \ the importance of filial piety is stressed, being that the family is the basic\
      \ unit of society.\n\nThe author then goes on to discuss not social mobility,\
      \ but physical mobility, and ends the article saying:\n\n>That's a very different\
      \ social context for Confucianism.  Again, perhaps it can be adapted to modernity,\
      \ but that adaptation will have to deal squarely with the challenge of mobility,\
      \ in all of its forms, or fast-paced Chinese city dwellers will leave Confucianism\
      \ behind as they speed along in their bullet trains.\n\nIt seems the author\
      \ is trying to say that China is not a *Confucian* society due to its rapid\
      \ modernization. There is merit in this idea, of course, but to say simply that\
      \ China **is not** a *Confucian* society is a bit ambitious. Certainly, traditions,\
      \ values, and social structures have changed drastically, but the remnants of\
      \ these shouldn't be underestimated. There is a dangerous school of thought\
      \ that everything 'traditional' is lost with modernization, but that is not\
      \ true. Yes, our world has seen dramatic changes, but it has always been so,\
      \ and Confucianism itself has withstood these transformations throughout time.\
      \ Never before was it such that Chinese society was in perfect harmony with\
      \ Confucian ideals, or that these profound concepts were upheld by each and\
      \ every citizen. More to the point, China, and all of East Asia for that matter,\
      \ having been under strict rule by Confucian governments (not necessarily wholeheartedly\
      \ abiding the Way), have been certainly molded and acculturated with customs,\
      \ values, and beliefs that would be hard to discard even in the age of Globalization."

  - body: 'I''m not an expert about Xunzi''s writings, but there are a few points
      about him and his thoughts that may help put his ideas into perspective with
      "Confucian" philosophy as a whole.


      Unlike canonical Confucian philosophy (Confucius, Mencius, Zhuxi etc.), Xunzi''s
      ideas were premised on a conception of human nature being essentially evil.
      Whereas Confucianism traditionally saw propriety/ritual/self-control as the
      practical virtue of embodying this originally good nature, or the Tao, Xunzi
      saw it as being the necessary means for bridling the evil nature of human beings,
      transforming them into civilized people. He thought that goodness could only
      be cultivated, and that it was not innate to our existence. Therefore, hierarchy
      is understood from his point of view as a necessary structure that systematically
      breaks the evil nature of humans, making civilization possible in the process.
      Of course, hierarchy has always been present in Confucian civilization. Xunzi''s
      point of departure from the canonical "inside-outward" paradigm of Confucian
      thought is in his idea that Goodness is obtained (outside-inward). For both,
      hierarchy is a practical necessity of civilization, but its purpose and moral/ethical
      imperatives are understood differently according to their respective views of
      human nature/existence.


      Though Xunzi was a student of Confucius, he lived at a time when a Confucian
      doctrine hadn''t really been established. It''s important to realize that although
      the different schools of thought at the time had particular premises that distinguished
      them from one another, their time was one when the lines between them didn''t
      indicate incommensurable differences necessarily. They all have their roots
      in the same traditions of thought and were working on the same philosophical/social
      project, and so at this time in particular when these schools hadn''t necessarily
      matured into full-blown doctrines, we see lots of variation even within single
      "schools." Xunzi''s so-called "realist" perspective could be attributed to Legalist
      influence which was strong at the time, and against which Mencius fought adamantly.
      As tradition has shown, Xunzi''s views were too major of a variation from what
      was understood to be true about the Tao, not just by "Confucians" but even Taoists
      and later Buddhists. '

  selftext: So I'm currently reading through Xunzi The Complete Text, who was a student
    of Confucius. It seems to me that he was very fond of bringing up hierarchy all
    the time. When I was reading The Four Books, I learned about how Confucianism
    liked hierarchy to maintain order but compared to the talk about Goodness and
    The Superior Man, it played a small role. It baffles me that Xunzi talks so much
    about this subject. Any thoughts?

      I keep trying to answer my own question, but am confused.  Is Taiji (supreme
      polarity) the Tao?  If so, then wouldn''t there be a yet greater polarity between
      itself and the indeterminate?  Is the indeterminate the Tao?  If so, then how
      can distinctions arise from it?


      Is Tao a concept that includes both Taiji and Wuji?

  selftext: 'Dear Reddit,


    I seem to remember that my Chinese Philosophy lecturer once said something about
    how Confucian philosophy has this weird culinary metaphor to describe the unity
    of different properties in a thing. I believe it was about several distinct tastes
    within a well-cooked soup (as opposed to a bad soup in which all the tastes kind
    of just merge and blend into one another) or something like that. I''ve looked
    through my notes and not found anything - but this might be because of my laziness.
    Google hasn''t helped me either, all the results I get are about Chinese cuisine.
    Anyway I''d like to know more about this. Is this mentioned in the analects? Is
    there a good secondary source you can recommend (of course, preferably one that''s
    accessible online)? Or is my memory just deceiving me and I''m somehow confusing
    something and there is actually nothing like this in Confucianism?


    The reason I''m asking is because I''ve been reading Hegel''s Phenomenology of
    Spirit, and in Chapter IV he seems to discuss precisely this "soup" at length
    (the metaphor he uses is actually astonishingly similar, he speaks of a "liquid").
