  selftext: "Edit: To clarify, I imagine the flight paths would look similar to a\
    \ laser pointer through fog. Not necessarily bright red, but transparent or at\
    \ least semi-transparent so as to be visible without totally obstructing one's\
    \ vision. \n\nYou are welcome to suggest additions to the trails that would kick\
    \ this hypothetical up a notch, like bullets that hit a person would have blue\
    \ trails, versus bullets just shot being gray. You can add a way for the trails\
    \ to be dated so that we could see how long they've been around. \n\nEdit 2: Didn't\
    \ want to get too specific but the question has come up numerous times. I initially\
    \ meant bullets to mean bullets from guns such as pistols, revolvers, rifles,\
    \ shotguns, etc. You are welcome to discuss what would happen if trails followed\
    \ the trajectory of bombs and missiles and cannons and shells fired from naval\
    \ ships because I like what it adds to the conversation. \n\nAdditionally, the\
    \ trails are left relative to the earth's surface. So they start above the earth\
    \ where the person was standing and the gun was fired and end where the bullet\
    \ stopped flying, be that because it hit a person, building, the ground, what\
    \ have you. You can walk through them, they are a permanent fixture but they are\
    \ the consistency of the air around them. I really don't know that I want to get\
    \ more specific into the scientific possibility of how it would work, this being\
    \ a hypothetical and all. "

    \ nobody's thought of before. We know a lot of you get sick of seeing the same\
    \ questions every day, and to be honest we do a bit too. So we're going to hold\
    \ a competition for the next fortnight. It will go as follows:\n\n* the question\
    \ deemed most original *and* discussion inspiring as voted *by the mods* will\
    \ receive reddit gold, a little bit of recognition, and probably front page status\
    \ when the thread is posted\n\n* NSFW threads do not qualify. We want originality,\
    \ not something you can jerk off to.\n\n* threads do not have to be marked as\
    \ serious to be considered. \n\n* most importantly: this is not forced entry.\
    \ If you do not wish to wrack your brain thinking of something new, feel free\
    \ to ask what cancelled TV show you'd revive (it's always Firefly). /r/AskReddit\
    \ will continue to function exactly as normal, and threads will be both nominated\
    \ and voted (silently) by us. When we browse, we will see a question we like and\
    \ add it to our list. \n\nThe reason it is going to be like the is because we\
    \ are hoping it will promote more original questions; people see the contest,\
    \ they want to win it, so they wrack their brains for the best question. Other\
    \ people notice more original questions getting posted, this creates a snowball\
    \ effect as people enjoy all this new content, so they create their own. Eventually,\
    \ this drives forward to a singularity event where afterwards, AskReddit mods\
    \ have ultimate pow...uh, um, the best subreddit there is. Yeah. \n\nAlso, if\
    \ the experiment works, we may even do it again\n\nTo clarify: this is just a\
    \ thread to announce and talk about it. You don't post the questions in here.\
    \ Continue to use /r/AskReddit the way you always have. If you have any questions,\
    \ feel free to ask them below and we'll do our best to help you"

    \ begin at the time of this post and will run for two weeks. While discussion\

    \ where the main part of the question is sex. This includes, but is not limited\
    \ to questions about pornography, sexual experiences and personal preferences\
    \ in regards to sex. These questions will be automatically removed by the automoderator\
    \ based on a number of keywords and redirected to /r/AskRedditAfterDark (AskReddit,\
    \ but NSFW) or one of the subreddits mentioned below. But automoderator is not\
    \ flawless. If you see a post that you think violates the rule, please report\
    \ the offending post and we'll take a look.\n\nHere are some subreddits you can\
    \ check out in the meantime:\n\n* /r/AskRedditAfterDark \n* /r/sex\n* /r/AskMen\
    \ \n* /r/AskWomen (both found in the [ask gender multi-reddit](/u/AskReddit_Multis/m/ask_gender))\n\
