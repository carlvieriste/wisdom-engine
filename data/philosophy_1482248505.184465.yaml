  selftext: "We read Apology of Socrates on my first day in university. I haven't\
    \ read it again for years. We don't sacrifice roosters for Asklepios anymore,\
    \ so this is a good excuse to read it again:\n\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1023144\n\
    \nAs a bonus, death of Socrates from Phaedo:\n\n\"At the same time he held out\
    \ the cup to Socrates. He took it, and very gently, Echecrates, without trembling\
    \ or changing color or expression, but looking up at the man with wide open eyes,\
    \ as was his custom, said: \u201CWhat do you say about pouring a libation to some\
    \ deity from this cup? May I, or not?\u201D \u201CSocrates,\u201D said he, \u201C\
    we prepare only as much as we think is enough.\u201D \u201CI understand,\u201D\
    \ said Socrates; \u201Cbut I may and must pray to the gods that my departure hence\
    \ be a fortunate one; so I offer this prayer, and may it be granted.\u201D With\
    \ these words he raised the cup to his lips and very cheerfully and quietly drained\
    \ it. Up to that time most of us had been able to restrain our tears fairly well,\
    \ but when we watched him drinking and saw that he had drunk the poison, we could\
    \ do so no longer, but in spite of myself my tears rolled down in floods, so that\
    \ I wrapped my face in my cloak and wept for myself; for it was not for him that\
    \ I wept,  but for my own misfortune in being deprived of such a friend. Crito\
    \ had got up and gone away even before I did, because he could not restrain his\
    \ tears. But Apollodorus, who had been weeping all the time before, then wailed\
    \ aloud in his grief and made us all break down, except Socrates himself. But\
    \ he said, \u201CWhat conduct is this, you strange men! I sent the women away\
    \ chiefly for this very reason, that they might not behave in this absurd way;\
    \ for I have heard that  it is best to die in silence. Keep quiet and be brave.\u201D\
    \ Then we were ashamed and controlled our tears. He walked about and, when he\
    \ said his legs were heavy, lay down on his back, for such was the advice of the\
    \ attendant. The man who had administered the poison laid his hands on him and\
    \ after a while examined his feet and legs, then pinched his foot hard and asked\
    \ if he felt it. He said \u201CNo\u201D; then after that,  his thighs; and passing\
    \ upwards in this way he showed us that he was growing cold and rigid. And again\
    \ he touched him and said that when it reached his heart, he would be gone. The\
    \ chill had now reached the region about the groin, and uncovering his face, which\
    \ had been covered, he said\u2014and these were his last words\u2014\u201CCrito,\
    \ we owe a cock to Aesculapius. Pay it and do not neglect it.\u201D \u201CThat,\u201D\
    \ said Crito, \u201Cshall be done; but see if you have anything else to say.\u201D\
    \ To this question he made no reply, but after a little while he moved; the attendant\
    \ uncovered him; his eyes were fixed. And Crito when he saw it, closed his mouth\
    \ and eyes.\n\nSuch was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, who was, as we may\
    \ say, of all those of his time whom we have known, the best and wisest and most\
    \ righteous man.\"\n\nAnd remember, the unexamined life is not worth living."

  selftext: 'Philosophy should be just as important as math, science, english, etc,
    in school. The reason I believe this is because philosophy forces you to know
    WHY you think something, it forces you to think through opinions/issues LOGICALLY,
    something that''s not done enough.


    The ability to use logic (predominantly at least) when discussing ideas and issues
    is viewed as special and gifted, unnatainable for the average person. The perception
    of it is that someone like Sam Harris (fascinating guy, look him up) can only
    think how he does because of genetics, or pure talent. But I doubt that''s true.
    Philosophy is largely logical, just like math (though math is purely logical).
    Meaning, if we can teach kids to understand 2+2=4, we can teach them to logically
    account for other people''s perspectives and teach them to understand what it
    truly means to think. Now I don''t think many people would argue that Philosophy
    is useless (not talking about post degree job opportunities here) but I don''t
    think many would argue it''s just as important as core classes either.


    So why do I believe it''s just as important? Because how much time in our lives
    do we spend talking to people, hearing their ideas, and listening to their perspectives?
    The answer is a shit ton of time.


    If people were educated on the logical formula of thinking (yes, there is one)
    imagine how much more cooperative we would be. Of course it would change life
    in general, but imagine how US (or general) politics would be if Philosophy was
    just as valued as core classes in k-12. Instead of constantly calling each other
    bigots, racist, libtards, etc the average dinner table political debate could
    actually be centered around why one opinion/idea would work better than other.


    Here is a example of what happens when Philosophy isn''t emphasized:


    "I think all of those damn illegals need to get out of this country!"


    "You''re just a intolerant bigot!"


    After Philosophy is emphasized:


    "I think all of the illegal immigrants need to get out of this country"


    "Why? What negative impact do they have?"


    "Well they take our jobs"


    "But all the evidence and research says they don''t"


    "But what makes them entitled to US citizenship?"



    And back and forth. Instead of name calling, actual logical discussion.


    If everyone was trained to take in account a persons life expirence which forms
    their perspective, be taught the logic that

    could be used when discussing ideas, and be taught the true nature and meaning
    of thinking, we would all get along much better, and more would get done.


    This is not to say everyone should have the same opinion. That''s not what Philosophy
    is. Take the example above for instance, the one arguing to deport the illegal
    immigrants is asking why they are inherently allowed to live here, which is a
    perfectly legitimate philosophical question/opinion. But there is a philosophical
    counter argument to that point that is just as legitimate. Even if I could wave
    a magic wand and this all come to fruition, people would disagree constantly.
    There is a logical formula to thinking but that doesn''t mean only one specific
    result can come out of a certain thought and be logically and philosophically
    sound. Logic can''t completely dictate Philosophy, it just can''t. There is a
    clear, sound, logic to both the pro and anti immigrant persons argument, but mostly
    it''s a moral position, which logic cannot always control. Another example: The
    discussion of what people think everyone is entitled or not entitled to is a intresting
    one. When someone says "all people should have the right to live, so all people
    deserve healthcare free of charge" there is a logic to that, but it is a largely
    moral opinion. The exact same could be true of the opposite opinion "No one is
    entitled to anything on this earth, things are earned". Both of those opinions
    can''t be proven or disproven logically,(er well... At least in the context I''m
    talking about) but that doesn''t make them invalid. Logic can''t dictate everything.


    So in conclusion: Schools should teach students the nature of thinking, the inherently
    logical aspect to thinking, and to respect different moral conclusions. Regarding
    the latter, most people would take that up to a point, many aren''t going to sympathize
    or respect grossly authoritarian or discriminating opinions. Which nothing about
    philosophical logic and the nature of morality contradicts. I''m not trying to
    get rid of "values" people have at all. Differences of opinion are good, the inability
    to understand the logic and more often morality of why someone thinks what they
    do, is not good


    EDIT 1: Ok so just saying "Philosophy" seems to have (somewhat) convoluted my
    point. I dont want 6th grader to have to take a year long class about the history
    of philosophy. I want a class that encourages largely philosophical type thinking,
    but it shouldn''t be teaching everyone about certain Philosophy niches and the
    full understanding of certain things within Philosophy if that makes sense. Philosophical/logical
    type thinking with understanding towards different mortalities.. That''s what
    I want the class to be basically. Would most likely have a different name than
    "Philosophy". It would just borrow somethings from Philosophy as we think of the
    course now.


    EDIT 2: So I am a sophomore in high school who wrote the OP to bring up a interesting
    idea that I would never pretend is perfect. If this were to actually happen, so
    many kinks and things would need to be figured out and our culture would have
    to change pretty significantly in the US for this to ever be a reality. I think
    this has been a pretty cool discussion here and my perspective on this is different
    than when I first posted it because of the discussion. I did not post this to
    preach about how terrible everyone is, I posted just to see what people thought
    about this really.

    I do really believe that our society could improve with more emphasis on understanding
    other''s perspectives and having a more logical, perhaps rational thinking process
    on ideas, and other people''s ideas. When I said we need more logic, I meant in
    regards to discussing and perceiving ideas. I''m not saying everyone is illogical
    about everything because if that were the case there would be no Reddit for me
    to post on. Or a phone for me to type on. Clearly, we have our fair dose of logic
    all around.

    However logic regarding ideas is different than logic regarding most other things.
    Because with ideas, emotion and bias are thrown in. I would not want to live in
    a world with no emotion and it''s something humans will have forever, well, unless
    robots or some shit. However, I think many people in the country are allowing
    their (usually) well intentioned pride and emotion to cloud their ability to have
    a productive discussion with people that think differently. I''m not going to
    pretend to not have allowed emotion and pride to cloud my judgement sometimes,
    of course it has.

    But I just feel, that if the way of thinking and analyzing ideas in Philosophy
    was more valued in our culture, we would be more united and productive. Of course
    we cannot get rid of emotion in our thinking, we never should. But we can become
    a society that is more critical thinking and productive when discussing ideas.
    There is no reason why we can''t. Clearly I don''t mean this will happen in a
    year, but there is no reason that we can''t strive to eventually improve more
    and more when talking about ideas.

    As I said in the OP, many ideas are going to be rooted in morality. That''s not
    because they''re illogical, it''s because that''s how many ideas just are. Logic
    doesn''t dictate all ideas. If I said that all humans have certain rights just
    because they''re human dammit, there is no logic to that. But it''s not illogical
    either. It''s just a idea my morals lead me to. So often we think people''s ideas
    are ridiculous and just attack them without thinking about why they might have
    that idea, which only serves to hurt both ways. Of course some ideas are predominantly
    based in logic, and at that point yeah, some ideas make more sense than others.
    But even then if you want to actually have a productive conversation with someone
    who has a different perspective on it, being a cunt isn''t going to do anything.
    Not many people have had their mind expanded because they got called a name and
    mocked.

    I also imagine a society, where everyone could name a reason for their opinion.
    Not only do so many people not"question everything", so many people question nothing.
    So many people have strong convictions about things but can''t name any actual
    reason for it, and this doesn''t just happen with socially akward adults on Reddit
    lol.

    If our education system put more emphasis on our ability to independently think
    and analyze things we would be better off. This is not to say we should scrap
    the education system and start from scratch, but we should make more of a effort
    to encourage critical thinking.

    Based on some responses on here, I can understand if you think my idea isn''t
    actually a Philosophy class, but just borrows elements of Philosophy to encourage
    intellectual thinking. I also realize the class would have to be different than
    many Philosophy classes you can take at various levels of educatuon right now.
    And perhaps this wouldn''t start until 6-7th grade once people are more mature.
    I still think we could find a way to encourage philosophical type thinking at
    the beginning grades, but clearly to a different degree than the higher ones.'

  selftext: "Hello, I was given the above prompt for my philosophy course on meaning\
    \ and happiness, and I thought that it would be interesting to share my response\
    \ with you all. The professor is a leading Nietzsche scholar, and I received high\
    \ marks. So, what do you all think of my response, and do you agree? Tear it apart!\
    \  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\u2019s rejection of prior conservative\
    \ accounts\u2014preservations and adaptations of the Christian meaning of life\u2014\
    \ for the meaning of life marked the beginning of radicalism in searching for\
    \ philosophical meaning. A need to find universal meaning, Nietzsche claims, is\
    \ for the weak; instead, the German philosopher calls for man to reject these\
    \ \u2018nauseating\u2019 universal worldviews and to embrace one\u2019s own meaning\
    \ in life. To craft a personal meaning of life\u2014rather than blindly accepting\
    \ the tenants of Christianity, Buddhism, or Islam\u2014is, to Nietzsche, the way\
    \ towards a good life. In developing this narrative \u2018story of one\u2019s\
    \ life,\u2019 Nietzsche\u2019s recommendation is to become the novelist, screenwriter,\
    \ director, or \u2018poet\u2019 of one\u2019s own life. If one curates events,\
    \ relationships, beliefs, and spirituality in the same way that Joyce wrote Ulysses\
    \ or Shakespeare penned Hamlet, then the meaning from a life well lived will spring\
    \ forth. I agree with Nietzsche\u2019s call for man to \u201Clook to artists\u201D\
    \ for the good life, and I believe that he understood an emotional, Dionysian\
    \ element of life that was missing from Western society during his time. \n\n\
    &nbsp;\n\nNietzsche\u2019s claim is that in order to become the poets of our own\
    \ lives, we must i) regard ourselves with some objective distance, ii) create,\
    \ rather than adopt, a unique perspective on life, while bearing in mind physics,\
    \ and iii) have a positive esteem of who that person is so that, ultimately, one\
    \ can pass his \u201Ceternal return of the same\u201D test. To support Nietzsche\u2019\
    s argument, I will walk through each of the three parts, citing examples of art\
    \ that have compelled me to defend his claim along the way. Just as the theatre\
    \ director interrupts, scolds, and praises his actors during rehearsals\u2014\
    so that the finished product, the play on opening night\u2014so too must individuals\
    \ objectively\u2014that is, without bias or sentimentality\u2014criticize their\
    \ own lives. Nietzsche called us to be poets, but I believe that he most meant\
    \ man to be a director, since a poet can create his work in solidarity, while\
    \ by the very nature of stagecraft, the playwright or director must inspire others\
    \ to create a play worth seeing. This objective distance of a playwright can lead\
    \ man to criticize philosophical and intellectual ideas that comprise one\u2019\
    s self, such as religion, views on violence, economic and political principles,\
    \ and what to do with one\u2019s time on Earth. This process necessitates periodic\
    \ moments of honest reflection\u2014similar to a Catholic confessional, though\
    \ without the need for a Christian God\u2014that Nietzsche took during his summers\
    \ in the Swiss Alps. While most men today cannot afford annual trips to Switzerland,\
    \ man can take stock of his life in nature, such as public parks and what have\
    \ you. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust as an artist that made a facsimile of Michelangelo\u2019\
    s David\u2014no matter how accurate\u2014and peddled it as his own would be labeled\
    \ a counterfeiter, a fraudster, so too are those who adopt universal attempts\
    \ at meaning as defined by global religions. While the argument could be made\
    \ that adopting Nietzsche\u2019s recipe for the good life is also a copy of someone\
    \ else\u2019s meaning of life, Nietzsche brilliantly describes how one should\
    \ find meaning, and not, importantly, what that meaning will be. Thus, one must\
    \ choose for himself what life is to be, and so long as life is a) individual\
    \ and b) chosen (rather than discovered in a religious delirium), then one is\
    \ able, but not guaranteed, to live a happy life. I believe that Nietzsche\u2019\
    s requirement that this meaning takes physics under consideration to be an admonishment\
    \ against religious worldviews. An individually chosen life provides one with\
    \ the best shot at being happy, and while I am not certain, I believe that Nietzsche\
    \ would agree that following this path is not a guarantee at happiness, but rather,\
    \ is the best chance one has. One could individually choose to be a serial killer\
    \ of philosophy professors, but that does not make that life happy. Furthermore,\
    \ a billionaire could choose a noble life of helping the poor and giving away\
    \ his wealth, but even still he could be unhappy. The unhappy serial killer is\
    \ best explained by the third stipulation from die Fr\xF6hliche Wissenschaft,\
    \ that we must \u2018esteem\u2019 that person we choose to be. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\
    Even though a serial killer of philosophy professors may have chosen to be who\
    \ he is for himself, his life is not of meaning since at his core, he would not\
    \ esteem or respect who he is. It is because of this last requirement that Nietzsche\
    \ calls us to look to artists, for only the best artists\u2014in Nietzsche\u2019\
    s mind, and I quite agree\u2014are able to pass this final hurdle: the test of\
    \ the eternal return of the same. Surely the serial killer would respond to the\
    \ demon by gnashing his teeth; however, after reflecting on his works, JW von\
    \ G\xF6the would live his life again. The poet creates art that is free from religious\
    \ delusions or self-deception, and is instead an honest expression of one\u2019\
    s love, passions, fears, and ambitions. Thus, if we take to heart Nietzsche\u2019\
    s call to \u201Cbecome the poets of our own lives,\u201D then we, too, can be\
    \ like G\xF6the and live lives of true meaning and purpose. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThough\
    \ his life was cut short prematurely, Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy\u2014especially\
    \ this call to look to artists for meaning\u2014resonates within me as I build\
    \ relationships, take academic courses, and look towards starting my career. Nietzsche\
    \ recognized that the late-nineteenth century\u2019s Western society lacked the\
    \ Dionysian passion and emotion of the great poets, and instead dwelled in an\
    \ unbalanced Apollonian state of reserved rationalism. By inspiring his readers\
    \ to embrace inner passions and not lose their emotional fire, Nietzsche\u2019\
    s call to be the poets of our own lives rings true to this day.\n\nEDIT: Basic\
    \ spacing corrections. \nNB: we were given this prompt during our final exam session\
    \ and had approximately 35 minutes to respond to this and another question. "

  selftext: "When you look at your arms and legs, clearly they are yours, or at least\
    \ part of what makes up \"you\". But you are more than just a body. You have thoughts\
    \ flowing through your mind that belong exclusively to the subjective \"you\"\
    . \n\nSo who exactly are you? Are you the whole package? I am going to suggest\
    \ that you are not. \n\n**The Coma**\n\nSuppose tomorrow you fell into a coma,\
    \ and remained unconscious for decades until finally passing away. From your perspective,\
    \ what value would you attribute to the decades you spent laying in a bed, unconscious\
    \ and unaware of your own existence? \n\nFrom your perspective, there would be\
    \ no difference between whether you died tomorrow or decades from now.\n\nTo your\
    \ family and loved ones, that your body is technically alive gives them hope -\
    \ the prospect that you might regain consciousness. But even to them, it's as\
    \ if you've lost the essence of being \"you\" unless you reawaken. \n\n**Physicality**\n\
    \nTechnically, for several decades, you would be alive. That is your body laying\
    \ there. Those are your internal organs being kept alive. \n\nBut everything that\
    \ you value about being you is found in your conscious awareness. This is why\
    \ there's such a striking difference between losing an arm and losing a head.\n\
    \nWhat is more important to you? Your physical being, or your notions of consciousnesses?\
    \ \n\nForget about the idea that you need both of them. Your comatose body can\
    \ survive for decades without your consciousness. And your body is constantly\
    \ reproducing itself at the cellular level without interfering with your consciousness.\n\
    \nThe value of \"you\" is the idea of your subjective awareness, which is entirely\
    \ tied to your consciousnesses.\n\n**Streams of Consciousness**\n\nThough that\
    \ may seem to sum it up nicely, there's a problem. Leading neuroscientists and\
    \ philosophers have been slowly converging on the idea that consciousnesses is\
    \ not all its cracked up to be. \n\nWhat you perceive to be a steady steam of\
    \ experiences is merely a number of layered inputs that give the impression of\
    \ a fluid version of reality. There have been an abundance of experiments that\
    \ demonstrate this convincingly (see \"change blindness\").\n\nNow that might\
    \ not be so bad. When you go to a movie, the fact that you are seeing a massive\
    \ series of still images perceived as fluid motion is not problematic. \n\nWhat\
    \ is perhaps unsettling is that the more we dig, the more we are led to the notion\
    \ that what we think of as being consciousness is mostly an illusion. That doesn't\
    \ mean we don't have awareness, we just don't have the level of awareness we think\
    \ we do.\n\nMost people have this notion that we take in reality and its stored\
    \ inside somewhere. Why, after all, can we close our eyes and envision our surroundings.\
    \ This is what famed philosopher Dan Dennett refereed to as the \"Cartesian Theater\"\
    \ three decades ago. He refuted the notion that there is a single place in our\
    \ brain somewhere that it all comes together, and neuroscience has spent the last\
    \ three decades validating this position. \n\nSo what is consciousnesses? Who\
    \ are \"you\"? Are you really just a very complex layer of perceptions melded\
    \ together to give you the illusions of self?\n\n**The Hard Problem**\n\nThe tricky\
    \ thing about consciousness is that we don't fully know how to explain it. David\
    \ Chalmers introduced the term \"The Hard Problem of Consciousness\" in the 1990s\
    \ that seemed to put a definitive wall between the things about the brain we can\
    \ explain easily (relating psychological phenomena to specific parts of the brain)\
    \ and those that are much more difficult (what consciousness actually is...\"\
    quala\"). \n\nRoger Penrose, a leading philosopher of science, perhaps explained\
    \ the issue best with the following: \n\n*\"There's nothing in our physical theory\
    \ of what the universe is like which says anything about why some things should\
    \ be conscious and other things not.\"*\n\nThus it would seem we really don't\
    \ know anything of substance about consciousness. Though that isn't wholly true.\
    \ For starters, there is a good case that there is no such distinction between\
    \ the easy and hard problems, they're all merely layers of one big problem. \n\
    \nA good metaphor for this is the weather. Until the last century, the complexity\
    \ of the weather reached well beyond any human understanding. But with investigation,\
    \ meteorology made huge strides over the past century. Though this knowledge did\
    \ not come easily, there was never any need to conclude there was a \"hard problem\
    \ of weather\". So why do we do it with the mind?\n\nThe answer may simply be\
    \ fear. If we discover that consciousnesses is nothing more than an emergent property\
    \ of a physical brain, we risk losing the indispensable quality of what it is\
    \ to be human. Many people reject the idea on the notion that its completely undesirable,\
    \ which has nothing to do with whether its accurate.\n\n**Room for Optimism**\n\
    \nWhen you fall asleep, there is a big difference between having a dream and a\
    \ lucid dream. The latter is magnitudes more interesting. If someone told you\
    \ that your lucid dream was still merely just a dream, they'd clearly be missing\
    \ the point. \n\nFrom our experience of awareness, consciousness isn't just the\
    \ opposite of unconsciousness, it feels like something. In fact, its everything.\
    \ It shouldn't  matter if consciousness is nothing more than a complex physical\
    \ process, its still beautiful.\n\nSo why does it even matter what we discover\
    \ about consciousness? There's much to be fascinated about, but none of it will\
    \ change what it feels like to be you.\n\nAnd besides, if our consciousness proves\
    \ to be nothing more than a feedback mechanism where billions of neurons are firing\
    \ away to give the illusion of observing reality, we still are left with one glaring\
    \ question: \n\n***Who is doing the observing?***\n\n________\n*(More crazy stuff\
    \ like this at: www.the-thought-spot.com)*\n"

  selftext: '**Thanks so much everyone for your questions! I''m out of time now.**


    I''m [Carrie Jenkins](https://www.carriejenkins.net/), a writer and philosopher
    based in Vancouver, BC. I am a Canada Research Chair in Philosophy at the University
    of British Columbia, the Principal Investigator on the SSHRC funded project [*The
    Nature of Love*](http://www.themetaphysicsoflove.com/), and a Co-Investigator
    on the John Templeton Foundation funded project [*Knowledge Beyond Natural Science*](https://www.templeton.org/what-we-fund/grants/knowledge-beyond-natural-science).
    I''m the author of a new book releasing on January 24, 2017 on the philosophy
    of love, *What Love Is And What It Could Be*, available for [pre-order now](https://www.amazon.com/What-Love-Could-Be/dp/0465098851).


    I studied philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge, and since then have worked
    at the University of St Andrews, the Australian National University, the University
    of Michigan, the University of Nottingham, and the University of Aberdeen. From
    2011 to 2016, I was one of three principal editors of the award-winning philosophy
    journal *Thought*. I recently won an [American Philosophical Association Public
    Philosophy Op Ed Contest](http://www.apaonline.org/news/304316/2016-Op-Ed-Contest-Winners-Announced.htm)
    award.


    This year I am also a student again, working towards an MFA in Creative Writing
    at the University of British Columbia.


    My philosophical interests have stubbornly refused to be pinned down over the
    years. Broadly speaking they include epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of
    mathematics, philosophy of logic and language, and philosophy of love. But I''m
    basically interested in everything. My first book was on [a priori arithmetical
    knowledge](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199231577.do), and my second
    is on the [nature of romantic love](https://www.carriejenkins.net/what-love-is-and-what-it-could-be/).
    I have [written papers](https://www.carriejenkins.net/papers/) on knowledge, explanation,
    realism, flirting, epistemic normativity, modality, concepts, dispositions, naturalism,
    paradoxes, intuitions, and verbal disputes ... among other things! A lot of my
    recent work is about love, because in addition to its intrinsic interest I see
    some urgency to the need for more and better critical thinking about this topic.


    My proof has been verified with the mods of /r/philosophy.

  selftext: "We live in a world that still prizes the central values of Christian\n\
    ethics: piety, asceticism, humility, and altruism. Even the social\nsciences that\
    \ inquire into the origins of human morality assume that this\nis what virtue\
    \ consists in (indeed, much of his criticisms of 19th-century\nnaturalistic moralists\
    \ such as Paul R\xE9e is still of great relevance\ntoday). Yet belief in the Christian\
    \ God, which stood at the centre of this\nworldview, has since crumbled, leading\
    \ many to question their received\ncategories of Good and Evil.\n\nIn On the Genealogy\
    \ of Morality, Nietzsche paints a vivid portrait of a\nvery different kind of\
    \ ethical life: an older tradition of thought and\npractice that flourished in\
    \ Ancient Greece and Rome, and which was\ncharacterized by reverence for strength,\
    \ nobility, independence, and\nsuccess in battle. By inviting us to view our own\
    \ moral standpoint from a\ndetached perspective, he encourages us to bring its\
    \ key assumptions into\nquestion. Whether or not one ultimately agrees with Nietzsche\
    \ that our\ncurrent moral valuations are standing in the way of humankind's true\n\
    greatness, this enquiry is one that is well worth engaging in.\n\nMy name is Don\
    \ Berry, and I received my PhD from University College\nLondon. I also have an\
    \ MA in mathematics from Cambridge and recently wrote an extensive, peer-reviewed\
    \ [analysis](https://www.macat.com/books/on-the-genealogy-of-morality-analysis)\
    \ of Genealogy of Morality for [Macat](https://www.macat.com/) . \nMy current\
    \ research lies at the intersection of ethics and biology. I am interested\nin\
    \ Greek virtue ethics and in what science has to say about the good life\nfor\
    \ human beings, looking to biology and other related disciplines to give\nthis\
    \ notion a fuller grounding that emerges as a matter of objective fact.\nAll of\
    \ these ideas have been sharply criticized by Friedrich Nietzsche, my\ngreatest\
    \ antagonist.\n\nThough I do not agree with many of Nietzsche's positive views,\
    \ his\nnegative critiques of other moral philosophers are so powerful that I\n\
    constantly find myself engaging with his arguments, and believe that all\nof his\
    \ works reward almost endless re-reading.\n\nInitially I was very impressed with\
    \ Nietzsche\u2019s scathing criticism of\nexisting moral philosophy. Against a\
    \ utilitarian morality based on\nsubjective feeling, he labels pleasure and pain\
    \ as foreground\nsuperficialities. Against a morality of sentiment, grounded on\
    \ inner\nfeelings of benevolence, Nietzsche cogently points out that our\nconsciences\
    \ can lead us astray and in fact require developing and training\nin relation\
    \ to some criterion that must therefore be external to them. And\nagainst a Kantian\
    \ morality grounded in the concepts of autonomy, reason,\nand duty, Nietzsche\
    \ pours scorn on such a construction and suggests that\nKant is a mere sophist\
    \ that is not to be taken seriously.\n\nI therefore concluded that Nietzsche was\
    \ correct in his assessment of\nmorality as a superficial mask worn to disguise\
    \ darker and more primitive\nforces, and that these thinkers were merely finding\
    \ rationalizations for\ntheir inherited moral viewpoint rather than engaging in\
    \ genuine enquiry.\nLater, however, I concluded that what Nietzsche\u2019s radical\
    \ individualism\nmisses is that human flourishing is to a large extent a matter\
    \ of the\nrelationships we enjoy with others. What is therefore needed is \na\
    \ return to a much older tradition stemming from Aristotle.\n\nNietzsche's masterpiece\
    \ On the Genealogy of Morality is essential reading\nfor anyone interested in\
    \ the historical basis of the dominant morality of\nEurope today, or who seeks\
    \ to gain a better understanding of our deepest-held values. Having reviewed this\
    \ fascinating book for [Macat](https://www.macat.com/), I am happy to take part\
    \ in what should be a fascinating discussion.\n\nI will be online throughout the\
    \ day starting at 1030 EST/1530 GMT till 1830 EST/2330 GMT**- now finished**\n\
    \nThank you all for your questions and comments \u2013\u2013 \n\nI have been overwhelmed\
    \ by the huge response from such a wide variety of quarters.\nI hope I have managed\
    \ to get back to all of you at least once -- apologies if this is not the case\
    \ or I have not had sufficient time to give everyone the attention their posts\
    \ deserve.\nI really enjoyed the discussion and feel I have learned a lot.\nI\
    \ have talked with Macat and arranged 3 months free access to the library, so\
    \ please do check out my analysis of Nietzsche's \"On the Genealogy of Morality\"\
    \ for more information. My analysis of 'Beyond Good and Evil' should also be available\
    \ fairly soon, and there are many others on a wide variety of topics within and\
    \ outside of philosophy. You just need to go follow this link https://www.macat.com/registration/vouchercode\
    \ and use the code NIETZSCHE\nOnce again, thank you all so much for making this\
    \ such a rewarding experience!\nDon Berry\n\"You have your way. I have my way.\
    \ As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.\"\

  selftext: "Hello subscribers (new and old) to /r/philosophy!\n\nWe're happy to announce\
    \ that we are [now a default subreddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/05/whats-that-lassie-old-defaults-fell.html).\
    \ \n\nFor those of you who are new here, please check out the sidebar (scroll\
    \ over topics to see a further explanation) and our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/faq).\
    \ We have relatively strict guidelines for posts (and have recently adopted stricter\
    \ guidelines for comments). But don't let that scare you! You don't have to be\
    \ a professional philosopher so long as you obey the rules.\n\nFor those of you\
    \ who have been here before, we intend for things to remain largely the same:\
    \ we will keep encouraging high-quality content while removing off-topic or \"\
    idle\" questions and musings. Ideally, the move to a default sub would increase\
    \ visibility without decreasing quality; however, the transition is new for us\
    \ as well, so we'll see what actually happens. What is likely is that there will\
    \ be an increase in well-intentioned but not-of-academic-quality posts and comments.\
    \ Please remember to not be too harsh to those who are making an effort. In this\
    \ regard, it cannot hurt to check out the sidebar or our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/faq)\
    \ to brush up on the rules and ideals of the subreddit.\n\nIf anyone has concerns\
    \ or questions, this is probably the place to air them. And, again, please feel\
    \ free to check out the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/faq).\n\n\
    EDIT: attempted to clarify what the issue involving questions is.\n\nEDIT 2: We've\
    \ decided to be a bit ... generous with the comments in this thread, largely so\
    \ that we don't end up squashing alternative views. Obviously, that leads to some\
    \ low-quality and off-topic comments. Similar comments will be discouraged in\
    \ non-Meta threads."

  selftext: 'First of all I think it''s a fantastic film (and even better comic!)
    with some excellent thinking points. The main one of which is- who out of these
    *super*men do you agree with? What is the ''best'' way to keep the peace? Do the
    ends justify the means?


    Nite Owl- Described by Ozymandias as a ''Boy Scout'', his brand of justice stays
    well within the law. Arrest troublemakers by the safest means possible, and lead
    by example. His style is basically not sinking to the level of criminals.


    The Comedian- Deeply believes all humans are inherently violent, and treats any
    trouble makers to whatever means he sees fit, often being overly violent. Dismisses
    any ''big plans'' to try and solve humanity''s problems as he thinks none will
    ever work.


    Rorschach- Uncompromising law enforcer, treats any and all crime exactly the same-
    if you break the law it doesn''t matter by how much.  Is similar to The Comedian
    and remarked that he agreed with him on a few things, but Rorschach takes things
    much more seriously. A complete sociopath, and his views are so absolute (spoiler!)
    that he allowed himself to be killed because he could not stand what Ozymandias
    had done at the end of the story.


    Ozymandias- started out as a super-charged version of Nite Owl, but after years
    of pondering how to help humanity he ultimately decides (spoiler!) to use Dr Manhattan''s
    power to stage attacks on every major country in the globe and thus unite everyone
    against a common enemy, at the cost of millions of lives.


    So of those, whose methodology would you go with?


    (note, not brilliant with definitions so if anyone who has seen the films has
    better words to describe these characters please do say!!)'

    concludes that looking at non-black furniture is evidence in favor of the hypothesis
    that "all ravens are black".


    The logic is seemingly sound, but the conclusion doesn''t seem right.


    And I think I know why:


    The paradox states that evidence can either be for, against or neutral to a hypothesis
    in unquantified degrees.


    But the example of the "all ravens are black" actually gives us some quasi-quantifiable
    information about degrees of evidence.


    In this case we can say that finding a non-black raven is worth 100% confirmation
    against the hypothesis that all ravens are black.


    On the other side, finding evidence such as a black raven or a blue chair may
    provide non-zero strength evidence in favor of the all ravens are black hypothesis,
    but in order to provide evidence in equal strength as proving the negation, you
    would need to view the entire set of all things that exist.


    And since the two equivalent hypothesis of "all ravens are black" and "all non-black
    things are not ravens", cover all things and ''all things'' is a blanket term
    referencing a set that is infinitely expandable: the set of evidence for this
    hypothesis is infinite, therefore an infinite amount of single pieces of evidence
    towards must be worth an infinitesimal amount of confirmation to the positive
    each.


    And when I say infinitesimal, I mean the mathematical definition, a number arbitrarily
    close to zero.


    And so a finite number of black ravens a non-black non-ravens is still worth basically
    zero evidence towards the hypothesis that all ravens are black, thereby rectifying
    the paradox and giving the expected result.


    Those of you less familiar with maths dealing with infinities and infinitesimals
    may understandably find this solution challenging to follow.


    I encourage those strong with the maths to help explain why an extremely large
    but finite number of infinitesimals is still a number arbitrarily close to zero.


    And why an infinite set of non-zero positive values that sum to a finite certainty
    (100%) must be made of infinitesimals.

  selftext: "In 1967, Guy Debord wrote his seminal work, [The Society of the Spectacle](http://library.brown.edu/pdfs/1124975246668078.pdf),\
    \ in which he described how the majority of society has become alienated from\
    \ their own lived experiences: \"The spectacle is not a series of images but a\
    \ social relation among people, mediated by images.\"  Basically, in the modern\
    \ day it has become possible to manufacture the narrative that the average person\
    \ uses as a lens to interpret the going-ons of daily life.  The manufacturing\
    \ process is some combination of mass media, socialization, careful PR management,\
    \ biases, etc. in different proportions.  I contend that it is much more enlightening\
    \ to understand Ferguson, Missouri through Debord's theory of Spectacle.\n\nOne\
    \ method of the spectacle was used in communist Russia (and is generally favored\
    \ by totalitarian states), where the state would only allow the media to tell\
    \ one carefully written narrative to make it the only game in town.  Generally,\
    \ research tells us that the media has agenda-setting and framing powers: meaning\
    \ it can influence what John Q. Public discusses at the water cooler at work and\
    \ roughly how we structure the sides in a debate.\n\nHowever, traditionally, America\
    \ has used a different method of choice of Spectacles.  In our society of niche\
    \ marketing, we manufacture several Spectacles for different people to choose\
    \ between.  In Ferguson, we saw two major narratives created around the same event:\
    \ the shooting of Michael Brown.  One narrative belonged to authorities and defenders\
    \ of Darren Wilson, and the other belonged to protesters and defenders of Michael\
    \ Brown.  What happened Monday night, with the vestiges of power choosing to not\
    \ indict Darren Wilson, is the latter narrative was basically declared invalid\
    \ by society, effectively switching us from the traditional American system of\
    \ tolerating competing narratives to the other system where the state appears\
    \ to officially endorse a Spectacle.\n\nBefore passing judgement on the authorities\
    \ or the rioters though, it's important we stop and take note that both sides\
    \ in this clash have engaged in wrestling over what has become the Spectacle of\
    \ Michael Brown's death.  We must call it the spectacle instead of \"the event\
    \ of Michael Brown's death\" now because the image-mediated narratives that are\
    \ competing with each other now dominate our discussion.\n\nOn the heads of the\
    \ authorities is their abhorrent conduct in the months leading up to Monday. \
    \ They were, rightly, [criticized for strategically leaking](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-leaks-20141022-story.html#page=1)\
    \ information, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kdK37TZPwo), and photographs\
    \ to effectively mediate how society came to know Michael Brown.  They wanted\
    \ us to see him as the menace, the robber, the \"black thug\" shot by police.\
    \  It's what we call \"[trying the case in the media.](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1493&context=lcp)\"\
    \  The authorities interested in defending Darren Wilson successfully exonerated\
    \ him in trial by media, arguably helping to avert trial in court.  \n\nThe authorities\
    \ went even further though by [harrassing journalists](http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-journalists-arrested/)\
    \ to restrict their ability to capture images of what's arguably their greatest\
    \ sin: the Orwellian policing of protesters by false assessment.  In august, they\
    \ seemed to be arbitrarily breaking up protests by declaring them no longer peaceful\
    \ without regard to whether or not they actually were peaceful.  Common complaints\
    \ included being arrested on the sidewalk for blocking roads.  [Journalists were\
    \ arrested for trespassing in a McDonald's (as customers) and denied the legally\
    \ required information about their arrest.](http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/08/14/wapo-journalist-recounts-arrest-police-ferguson-mcdonalds)\
    \  This served to completely undermine the credibility of the authorities as a\
    \ narrator, as well as fed the common suspicion common in the black community:\
    \ that police often only \"claim\" the people they shoot were trying to take their\
    \ guns for expediency.\n\nWhich leads into the protesters' failures.  They began\
    \ their own PR campaign (arguably before the police began theirs) to represent\
    \ Michael Brown as \"the gentle giant.\"  The friends and family of Michael Brown\
    \ went out to the media to effectively manufacture the image of Michael Brown\
    \ as \"a son and a friend.\"  They put their own relationships forward as a way\
    \ to allow people to empathize with them and to let them experience Michael Brown\
    \ as they experienced him.  However, that in itself is the creation of the image\
    \ of him as son and friend, not making him the actual son or the friend of the\
    \ community.  \n\nThis media battle between black victim/aggressor has become\
    \ so common in our media though that both sides essentially know the playbook.\
    \  That's why the police can take pre-emptive actions like isolating the media\
    \ in a press pen to keep them from being able to videotape whether or not those\
    \ protesters actually have become violent.  That's why the civil rights activists\
    \ that intend to put up a fight around the symbolism of a black man's dubious\
    \ death pre-emptively do their best to clean up the victim's image.  It's become\
    \ a mediated, manufactured political battle rather than a true search for truth.\
    \  It feeds and services the agenda and biases of the people that self-sort into\
    \ camps.  That's why public perception of what happened [is divided along racial\
    \ grounds](http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/),\
    \ because the Spectacles are constructed to service separate racial viewpoints\
    \ with small defections.\n\nHowever, the judicial process does not have room to\
    \ accommodate multiple spectacles.  That is why the courtroom and legal process\
    \ becomes the center of attention in these situations: to see which Spectacle\
    \ will carry the day.  Part of the protesters' narrative was that \"the fix is\
    \ in,\" the enduring belief that the authorities would protect themselves and\
    \ deny the legitimacy of the community's grievances.  To be honest, that view\
    \ is largely correct due to the tendency of \"White Spectacles\" to be privileged\
    \ and advanced beyond what is truthfully warranted.  Just another aspect of white\
    \ privilege; because when confronted with competing information, the human tendency\
    \ is to return to default and use our previous biases to evaluate the current\
    \ situation, and the default status in our society is still white privilege.\n\
    \nSo when the judicial process put its stamp of approval, as expected, on the\
    \ spectacle supported by the police in Ferguson, no one should have been surprised\
    \ and few were.  In the weeks before that decision, police and authorities continuously\
    \ signaled the belief that Ferguson would riot in response to the expected non-indictment.\
    \  They created the media expectation of violence and drew upon the mental image\
    \ all Americans have of \"race riots\" to mediate our expectations for Monday\
    \ night.  They issued calls for peace instead of expectations of peace, and their\
    \ calls effectively became expectations for violence.  And those expectations\
    \ were communicated through the media's framing power to the people, saying that\
    \ there would be opportunity for criminal activity, and thus became a self-fulfilling\
    \ prophecy when the authorities prepared to try to stop violence, and then did\
    \ not deploy the full force of those preparations (the governor's use of the national\
    \ guard, again, appears late, begging the question why deploy them early at all?)\
    \ \n\nEven here though, the protesters' leadership cannot escape blame.  They\
    \ announced hours before the verdict the intent to mobilize their networks of\
    \ peaceful, trained, non-violent protesters the next day, not overnight.  Although\
    \ the community organizers have traditionally understood their role as to give\
    \ emotion a positive place to go, they inexplicably abdicated that role ahead\
    \ of the 8pm announcement.  During the violence, the pro-protesters took great\
    \ pains to say to that it only takes one person to start a fire, to claim the\
    \ traditional refrain that the looting and violence is by a small minority.  There\
    \ is a conscious effort to redirect attention in the media to the peaceful sympathy\
    \ protests in other cities.  \n\nBut again, the images of the media interfere\
    \ with that narrative and mediate our understanding.  There's plenty of video\
    \ of crowds attacking police cars, what appeared to be a large coordinated smash\
    \ and grab on copter-cam at an O'Reily's autoparts, surging crowds of people smiling,\
    \ laughing, and almost reveling in the negative environment.  The clear intent\
    \ to control these images came out when, this time, it was the protesters and\
    \ the community that harrassed the journalists.  They threw rocks at reporters\
    \ who tried to film the burning stores, and appeared to even be using gunfire\
    \ to scare away and disperse the journalist encampment on West Florissant Avenue.\
    \  The desire to hide one's flaws is universal even between the oppressed and\
    \ the oppressor.\n\nSo what now?  I argue that we should not think we can take\
    \ any real insight away from the Spectacle of the death of Michael Brown.  Both\
    \ sides are so involved in creating and controlling the appearance of the event\
    \ that access to the truth is literally lost.  The police gave up their credibility\
    \ as a narrator by using Orwellian language to police the protesters in the early\
    \ days after the shooting, harassing the media to attempt to hide their unlawful\
    \ police tactics, and engaging in building up the Spectacle of Michael Brown the\
    \ thug.  However, the protesters have lost their credibility as a narrator as\
    \ well for giving in to large scale community violence, harassing the media to\
    \ attempt to hide that violence, and engaging in building up the Spectacle of\
    \ Michael Brown the gentle giant.  As a touchstone, Michael Brown's death has\
    \ been ground down by the friction between these two sides into dust in the wind.\
    \  The issues remain, but the abdication of the moral high ground by both sides\
    \ has left nowhere for a cavalry to moral witnesses to rush in (maybe with the\
    \ notable exception of highway patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who had no involvement\
    \ in the actual investigation of the death.)\n\nInstead, we should take a very\
    \ different kind of insight out of this event.  Here I think we should consider\
    \ Audrey Lorde's famous phrase, \"The Master's Tools will never dismantle the\
    \ Master's House.\"  There is a lot of [debate in philosophy](https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/blackspot-blog/audre_lorde.html)\
    \ about how to interpret these words even [in their original context](http://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lorde_The_Masters_Tools.pdf)\
    \ because its a hot issue in philosophy how to approach \"The Master's Tools,\"\
    \  AKA the mechanisms by which oppression occurs.  Some philosophers implore us\
    \ to use the Master's Tools against him, and some argue that you can't use those\
    \ tools at all as oppression is (according to them) inevitable when they are in\
    \ play.  Audrey Lorde gave us an even more hauntingly skilled and subtle idea...\
    \ (continued in comment)\n\n"

  selftext: "First off, english is not my native language so sorry for any grammar\
    \ mistakes. Also this ended up kinda long, so sorry for the wall of text. If you\
    \ are interested in the topic matter though, that should hopefully not be that\
    \ big of a problem :)\n  \nI've always been puzzled that nihilism gets such a\
    \ bad reputation. That it is always seen upon as destructive and negative. Either\
    \ Nihilism as a term needs to be further categorized up in sub-groups, or I have\
    \ misunderstood it completely.  \n  \nI will give an example. I believe in nihilism.\
    \ That noone or anything at all really, have any true/inherent meaning or purpose.\
    \ That morals is a human construct etc. However I consider nihilism something\
    \ positive. If life had any goal or meaning, that would hurt personal freedom.\
    \ It all boils down to objective and subjective meaning. I always considered that\
    \ nihilism mainly takes objective meaning into account. This as it is impossible\
    \ to deny that people value things personally/subjectively. Hence, objective meaning\
    \ only is the restriction that applies to nihilism.  \n  \nI do not believe in\
    \ any God, religion or any of that stuff. I also consider my own and all other\
    \ people's lives as ultimately having a zero value by this simple logic: You got\
    \ life for free. So when you die you actually do not lose anything really, as\
    \ you had nothing to begin with. Also since death is unavoidable and life is so\
    \ brief, that simply enhances the zero value of life.   \n  \nThe following is\
    \ why I consider nihilism positive and not negative, freedom. With no objectively\
    \ given purpose or meaning to life existing, you are 100% free to do whatever\
    \ you want. Since you came from nothing and life is finite, brief and death is\
    \ unavoidable - you have the freedom to do whatever you want.  \n  \nOne of the\
    \ biggest misconceptions about nihilism I have to deal with when I tell people\
    \ I'm a nihilist is \"You must be depressed, destructive, dangerous, evil etc.\"\
    \ Wrong - I'm happy BECAUSE life has no objective meaning and the freedom this\
    \ provides.   \n  \nThis next part is the most important, and what makes me wonder\
    \ if I have misunderstood the definition of nihilism. You see, I consider life\
    \ a free ride. I subjectively value things and people in life, and **ENJOY** life\
    \ even if I believe that objectively - we are all without any real value and that\
    \ when the earth and our species die we will be gone and forgotten. If someone\
    \ dies I do not get happy, but I do not get sad either (unless it is someone I\
    \ know which means a subjective anchor). Because it is natural and we simply returned\
    \ to having what we had before life, nothing.  \n  \nEither the majority of the\
    \ world does not properly understand nihilism, or my life philosophy is in practice\
    \ - not nihilism. This due to, like I said, people always coupling nihilism up\
    \ with negativity.  \n  \nI live life as a normal person and enjoy it very much.\
    \ Subjectively.  \nI do not believe any life, including my own, has any real objective\
    \ value or that we matter in any way.  \n  \nThere are two compliments that I\
    \ have gotten a lot in life. 1st, that I'm a good person. 2nd, that I am extremely\
    \ cynical. I'm the kind of person who wants to know the truth nomatter how much\
    \ it hurts and I consider myself a critical thinker. I believe in nihilism because\
    \ I believe it to be true, not because I want it to be true. That our lives do\
    \ not matter and that our entire existence is inconsequential. But that does not\
    \ mean I can not enjoy life subjectively.  \n  \nTo conclude: I enjoy life as\
    \ a person, and value people, things and everything. However I do believe that\
    \ our lives, our species and our planet does not have any real objective value\
    \ or more importantly - meaning. Doing what makes me happy gives my life meaning,\
    \ even if my life itself has no meaning - if that makes any sense.  \n  \nAgain.\
    \ I really hope someone can share some insights here. Have I misunderstood nihilism?\
    \ Or do you agree that nihilism needs further categorization? Because I read SO\
    \ much negative about nihilism and I can't help but to wonder what I'm missing."

  selftext: "My knowledge of philosophy is nearly nonexistant. Most of what I do know\
    \ about philosophy comes from people who are not philosophers. My knowledge is\
    \ based almost entirely around science (although I don't have a degree), and comes\
    \ from scientists. Because of this, I probably have assumptions about philosophy\
    \ that are not at all correct. In the same way, most people here are probably\
    \ going to have misconceptions about the scientific method. \n\nMost of the opinions\
    \ I have read about the difference between science and philosophy come from scientists\
    \ who probably don't understand philosophy. I also think that many philosophers\
    \ have a very limited view of the scientific method. \n\n**I am here to learn,\
    \ not convince a bunch of philosophers that they are wrong about what philosophy\
    \ is, please don't attack my claims, explain what misconception I have that caused\
    \ me to make them.**\n\nFirst of all, I am going to define a \"philosopher\" as\
    \ someone who follows all 3 of the following:\n\nA: has a background and education\
    \ in philosophy, \n\nB: calls themselves a philosopher, and \n\nC: Is considered\
    \ a philosopher by an the majority the people who fulfill requirements A and B.\n\
    \nI consider a scientist to be someone who does the following:\n\nA: Has a background\
    \ and education in a scientific field. [Defined here] (http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/whatisscience_03)\n\
    \nB: Calls themselves a scientist.\n\nC: Uses the scientific method.\n\nD: Is\
    \ accepted to be a scientist by the majority of people who fit requirements A\
    \ and B, and C\n\n**Please note that the definitions above are not mutually exclusive.**\n\
    \nMany people I have seen discussing this question on reddit claim that science\
    \ and philosophy are not mutually exclusive. Some even take this as far as to\
    \ say that science is not possible without philosophy.\n\nI know that science\
    \ can trace its origins back to philosophy, and that many major concepts in the\
    \ scientific method came from philosophers. However, if everyone who fits my definition\
    \ of a philosopher suddenly disappeared, science would be able to continue without\
    \ any difficulty.\n\nBesides concepts like falsifiability which were taken from\
    \ philosophy, I don't see how modern science is dependent on philosophy. It can\
    \ trace its origins back to philosophy, but how does make it a form of philosophy?\
    \ \n\nFrom my point of view, I cannot see why anyone who knows much about philosophy\
    \ would make a claim like this. Which means I am probably missing something. There\
    \ is something here I don't understand. What is it?\n\nThere are obviously questions\
    \ that science can't answer. Science can't say anything about ethics. Science\
    \ can't say anything about things you can't observe. It's methods and techniques\
    \ are difficult to apply to certain topics like the mind, consciousness, so on\
    \ and so forth."

  selftext: "I'm a physicist by profession and I'm sick of hearing all this stuff\
    \ about how \"science shows we don't have free will\"\n\nWhat the laws of physics\
    \ do is they can deterministically predict the future of a set of particles whose\
    \ positions and velocities are precisely known for all time into the future.\n\
    \nBut the laws of physics also clearly tell us in the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle\
    \ that the position and velocity of a particle fundamentally cannot be measured\
    \ but more than this ***is not defined***\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle\n\
    \nThis caveat completely turns determinism on it's head  and implies that it is\
    \ free will that is supported by science and not determinism.\n\nI cannot emphasize\
    \ strongly enough that the position of electrons is ***fundamentally*** undefined,\
    \ look at the structure of the p2 orbital\nhttp://cis.payap.ac.th/?p=3613\n\n\
    The p2 orbital of the hydrogen atom is composed of an upper probability cloud\
    \ where there is a high probability of finding an electron, a lower probability\
    \ cloud where there is the same probability of finding the same electron seperated\
    \ by an infinite plane of ***zero*** probability of finding the electron.\n\n\
    If the electrons position was defined then how does it get from the upper probability\
    \ cloud to the lower probability cloud without passing through the plane in the\
    \ middle??? \n\nFurthermore if there electron really was in one or the other dumbell\
    \ it would affect the chemical properties of the hydrogen atom in a manner that\
    \ isn't observed.\n\nSo the position and velocity of particles is ***fundamentally\
    \ undefined*** this turns determinism on its head.\n\nDeterminists will argue\
    \ that this is only the quantum realm and not macroscopic reality. By making such\
    \ a claim they display their ignorance of chaos theory and the butterfly effect.\n\
    \nThis was discovered by Lorenz when he ran seemingly identical computer simulations\
    \ twice. Look at the graph shown here.\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/~lbradley/seminar/butterfly.html\n\
    \nIt turned out that in one case the last digit was rounded down and in the other\
    \ the last digit was rounded up, from an initial perturbation of one part in a\
    \ million, initially the graphs seemed to track each other but as time progressed\
    \ the trajectories diverged.\n\nSo while the uncertainty principle only leaves\
    \ scope for uncertainty on the atomic scale the butterfly effect means that initial\
    \ conditions that differ on the atomic scale can lead to wildly different macroscopic\
    \ long term behaviour.\n\n\nThen there is the libet experiment \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet\n\
    \nWhere subjects were instructed to tell libet the time that they were conscious\
    \ of making a decision to move their finger. Libet found that the time subjects\
    \ reported being aware of deciding  to move their finger was 300ms after the actual\
    \ decision was measured by monitoring brain activity.\n\nYet even this is not\
    \ inconsistent with free will if the act of noting the time is made **sequentially\
    \ after** the free decision to move your hand.\n\nIf the subjects engage in the\
    \ following sequence\n1) Decide to move hand\n2) Note time\n3) Move hand\n\nThen\
    \ **ofcourse** people are going to note the time after they've freely decided\
    \ to move their hand, they're hardly going to do that before they've decided!\
    \ This experiment does not constitute a refutation of free will.\n\nFurthermore\
    \ bursts of neuronal noise are fundamental to learning and flashes of insight.\
    \ \nhttp://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=2683\n\nScience constantly tries\
    \ to find patterns in the world but most psychology experiments are based on statistics\
    \ from large samples. Anytime a sample behaves in a statistically significant\
    \ manner that is different from the control the psychologists say \"right we found\
    \ something else about how the brain works\" and they have. But only statistically,\
    \ most samples still have a spread within them and there's plenty of room for\
    \ free will in that spread. \n\nBut some scientists only see the pattern and forget\
    \ the noise (and as a researcher I can tell you most data is extremely noisy)\n\
    \nIt's this ignoring the noise that is biased, illogical and  causes people to\
    \ have far more faith in determinism than is warranted by the facts.\n\nI have\
    \ elaborate on these thoughts as well as morality and politics in this book I\
    \ wrote. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/Philosophical-Method-John-McCone/dp/1367673720\n\
    \nFurthermore a lot of free will skeptics assert that even if the universe is\
    \ random we should believe that our decisions are \"caused by a randomness completely\
    \ outside our control\" unless there is any reason to believe otherwise and since\
    \ there is no evidence that our actions are not caused by a randomness outside\
    \ our control believing in free will is unscientific.\n\n1) This position is fallacious\n\
    \n2) This position asserts an understanding of the underlying source of all random\
    \ events in the universe. An oxymoron, by definition a random event is an event\
    \ whose cause is unknown (radioactive decay being the most famous but any kind\
    \ of wave function collapse has an undetermined result that cannot be predicted\
    \ prior to it's occurrence)\n\n3) The very experience of free will serves as scientific\
    \ evidence in support of its existence, perhaps not conclusive evidence but evidence\
    \ that should not be dismissed in favour of bald assertions that cannot be backed\
    \ up that all random occurrences including those in our brain, are beyond our\
    \ control to influence.\n\nFirstly let me say that the basis of all science is\
    \ experience. The act of measurement is inseparably linked to the experience of\
    \ taking a measurement. In a way science is the attempt to come up with the most\
    \ consistent explanation for our experiences.\n\nIf you assume all experiences\
    \ are an illusion until proven real, you have to throw more than free will out\
    \ the window, you have to through general relativity, quantum mechanics, biology,\
    \ chemistry absolutely all science out the window, because the basis of all science\
    \ is recorded experience and if everything you experience is false (say because\
    \ you are in the matrix and are in a VR suit from birth) then your experience\
    \ of reading and being taught science is also false, even your experience of taking\
    \ measurements in a lab demonstration could be a false illusion.\n\nSo the foundation\
    \ of science is the default assumption that our experiences have weight unless\
    \ they are inconsistent with other more consistent experiences that we have.\n\
    \nWe experience free will, the sense of making decisions that we don't feel are\
    \ predetermined, the sense that there were other possibilities open to us that\
    \ we genuinely could have chosen but did not as a result of a decision making\
    \ process that we ourselves willfully engaged in and are responsible for.\n\n\
    The confusion among free will skeptics, is the belief that the only scientific\
    \ valid evidence arises from sense data. That that which we do not see, hear,\
    \ touch, smell or taste has no scientific validity.\n\nLet me explain the fallacy.\n\
    \nIt's true that the only valid evidence of events taking place outside of our\
    \ mind comes through the senses. In otherwords only the senses provide valid scientific\
    \ evidence of events that take place outside of our mind.\n\nBut inner experience\
    \ and feelings unrelated to senses **do** provide **scientifically valid** evidence\
    \ of the workings of the mind itself. Don't believe me? Then consider psychology,\
    \ in many psychological experiments that most people would agree are good science,\
    \ psychologists will had out questionaires to subjects asking them various aspects\
    \ of their feelings and subjective experience. The subjective answers that subjects\
    \ give in these questionaires  are taken as valid scientific evidence even if\
    \ they are based on feelings of the subjects rather than recorded things they\
    \ measured through our senses.\n\n\n\nIf we don't believe our mental experience\
    \ of free will and personal agency in spite of the fact that there is nothing\
    \ in science to contradict it, then why should we believe our sensory experience\
    \ of the world or indeed that anything that science has discovered has any basis\
    \ in reality (as opposed to making a default assumption of being inside the matrix)?"

  selftext: 'Hope this sub is appropriate. Any simplification is for brevity''s sake.
    This is not a "but what caused God" argument.


    Theists evoke God to terminate the universe''s infinite regress, because an infinite
    regress is incomprehensible. But that just transfers the regress onto God, whose
    incomprehensible infinitude doesn''t seem to be an issue for theists, but nonetheless
    remains incomprehensible.


    Atheists say that the universe always existed, infinite regress be damned.


    Either way, you''re gonna get something that''s incomprehensible: an always-existent
    universe or an always-existent God.


    **If your end goal is comprehensibility**, how does either position give you an
    advantage over the other? You''re left with an incomprehensible always-existent
    God (which is for some reason OK) or an incomprehensible always-existent *something.*


    Does anyone see the matter differently?

  selftext: "I believe it is fair to say that the average Human believes in peace\
    \ and understands that a world without conflict is best for us all. But while\
    \ these people understand that nations warring against each other is harmful for\
    \ everyone involved, they seem to forget this way of thinking when it comes to\
    \ the smaller things like letting someone off the hook when they unintentionally\
    \ slight another or choosing to not get involved in conflicts they don't fully\
    \ understand.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to discuss the faults of such\
    \ people who occasionally fail in upholding peace but to wrestle with our understanding\
    \ of the idea of peace so it can be better explained and exercised by both those\
    \ who preach it and those who receive its teachings.\n\nFirst, I want to cover\
    \ the difference between \"passive\" and \"active\" peacekeeping methods. What\
    \ I describe as being a passive method of peacekeeping is what we can do to reduce\
    \ conflict simply by doing nothing or by reducing our expected involvement in\
    \ a situation. As children, we are told that if someone is picking on you that\
    \ it is best to ignore the person that is trying to verbally harm you. While this\
    \ isn't taught under the pretense of preserving peace, it does well to preserve\
    \ it by not increasing conflict. This is the most \"pure\" form of passive peacekeeping\
    \ as it revolves around doing nothing; it's as passive as it gets. On the other\
    \ hand, we have passive peacekeeping methods which take on a more active approach.\
    \ Let's say that person who was picking on you before is being relentless and\
    \ they have it out for you. No amount of ignoring them will work so, you must\
    \ take a more active role in reducing conflict. A skilled word-smith would be\
    \ able to settle the dispute by appealing to the person's sense of reasoning but\
    \ depending on the situation, this may result in trying to dismantle the other\
    \ person's ideals as its those ideals which lead them to believe that it is okay\
    \ to attack others without provocation. Making the unreasonable see reason is\
    \ extremely difficult and I'll touch more on this subject later.\n\nNow to talk\
    \ about active peacekeeping which most of us understand as \"justice\". Justice\
    \ is the physical, non-abstract intervention into matters of conflict. Where passive,\
    \ and dialogue-filled approaches fail, you are encouraged to get in contact with\
    \ a superior who can intervene on the situation. This is what would be a \"pure\"\
    -Just resolution and just like the pure-passive resolution, it is imperfect because\
    \ it doesn't actually solve the root of the conflict; it simply puts a bar on\
    \ it in that specific area. I'm sure everyone remembers the stigma of being a\
    \ \"rat\" for telling on someone. This is a clear indication of the kind of lingering\
    \ disdain that would result from contacting a figure of authority and disdain\
    \ leads to conflict further down the road.\n\nSo far, we have established that\
    \ there are two pure methods of conflict resolution which result in conflict being\
    \ left unchanged while there is a median method which solves the problem by appealing\
    \ to reason. With this information, we can conclude that there is a problem with\
    \ each method but the method which seems the most appealing has a fatal flaw,\
    \ it doesn't work on everyone. That's where criminal justice systems and ignoring\
    \ the problem gain such traction. They are popular because they can easily be\
    \ applied to everyone. And this post isn't about demonizing people for taking\
    \ the easy way out because, I'll be honest, figuring out how to utilize that median\
    \ method on targets who are unwilling to listen is absurdly difficult but it's\
    \ a path that's worth pursuing because, if it can be made to apply to everyone,\
    \ then it will be near-perfect at increasing peace.\n\nNow, let's talk about the\
    \ idea of \"increasing peace\". What does it even mean to increase peace? By it's\
    \ very idea, peace is something that exists alongside the idea of \"discord\"\
    : chaos, malcontent, mischief. It is generally understood that by resolving one\
    \ situation, you create another because a balance of chaos and order must always\
    \ be achieved. However, this is only because the methods we are used to using\
    \ for resolving a conflict often revolve around hurting the other person or treating\
    \ them as an enemy. For those willing to put the effort into peace, there are\
    \ no enemies; only potential allies with varying degrees of difficulty to acquire\
    \ each one. By actually resolving a conflict by its roots, we reduce conflict.\
    \ By not having a reason to fight, people will often simply not fight. The world\
    \ is getting more peaceful by the day and that's because Humans are getting smarter;\
    \ better at resolving conflicts. Bad blood dissipates and we're left in a zero-state\
    \ of conflict.\n\nSo why, again, am I making this post? I said it was to wrestle\
    \ with the idea of peace on more specific terms but that's not the whole truth.\
    \ It would be better explained to say that the answer is in the question itself:\
    \ How do we make the unreasonable see reason? There's our answer; reason. Recently,\
    \ I had an intense argument with someone over a highly delicate and sensitive\
    \ personal issue to them. But by staying calm and prompting them to utilize reason\
    \ whenever there was a chance, I got them to calm down and at multiple points\
    \ through the discussion, I noticed them seriously pondering what I was telling\
    \ them. What I'm saying here may sound braggy but I simply want to illustrate\
    \ the point that sticking with reason works. If someone is capable of empathy\
    \ in the slightest, they will eventually have to consider your questions in a\
    \ serious manner. And if those questions are geared towards them seeing and generally\
    \ accepting reason, they will often be changed for the better. I have seen it\
    \ argued that you cannot change a person's core beliefs but I personally don't\
    \ think we have enough data to work with to make that call for absolutely certain.\
    \ Now, obviously, 100% certainty doesn't exist but what I'm saying is that  there\
    \ are methods which haven't yet been tested in a wide enough environment for us\
    \ to make calls like that. For the sake of peace, I want to see if teaching and\
    \ practicing reason can change Humanity for the better.\n\nWhile this would definitely\
    \ be a great place to end the post, there is one final matter that must be discussed.\
    \ It is a matter of dire importance because, if I didn't mention it, the purpose\
    \ of my post would collapse. Not only is it important to resolve issues through\
    \ peaceful and reasonable conflict resolution, it is also important to avoid becoming\
    \ the aggressor in our attempts to keep peace.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Imagine\
    \ that someone steps on your toes by accident and while this may annoy you, they\
    \ apologize immediately. In this situation, peace should be achieved because the\
    \ person who slighted the other made an attempt to neutralize the conflict. However,\
    \ there are times when a person will flip the table on the other person and become\
    \ the source of negativity in this situation. The other person apologizes and\
    \ you say, \"well you should be\".  The other person conceded and you demand further\
    \ submission from them. If I had to give this any name, I would call it \"domination\"\
    . Unfortunately, many Humans do this for reasons I'm psychologically incapable\
    \ of understanding or even empathizing with. Never have I been compelled to push\
    \ a situation where it shouldn't go and yet we see this everywhere. Driving down\
    \ the highway, you cut someone off because if you didn't, you'd have been stuck\
    \ waiting for a large line of cars to go by before you could get on the interstate.\
    \ Moments later, the person you cut off speeds alongside you to cut you off as\
    \ aggressively as they can. This, as you can imagine, has the exact opposite effect\
    \ of preserving peace. This kind of behavior where people over-react to minor\
    \ slights is what causes conflict. \n\nHow do we prevent this kind of conflict\
    \ escalation? By being vigilant; keeping our eyes peeled for when this kind of\
    \ situation might arise. If we stay focused and notice when we might be a potential\
    \ agent of conflict, we should take a step back then consider what we could do,\
    \ or not do, to nullify the conflict altogether. Sometimes, a conflict should\
    \ be resolved with words but other times, the best course of action is to do nothing.\
    \ If we can't reduce chaos, we should at least try to keep it from escalating.\n\
    \nSo, please, share this information with others. Preach reason to friends and\
    \ family alike but let them know that it's not because you think less of them.\
    \ Even those who are already fully capable of reason, let them know about this\
    \ interpretation of peace so that they may potentially grow in understanding how\
    \ to handle certain situations; to better benefit themselves and those around\
    \ them. And I want to clarify: I don't care about upvotes, downvotes, publicity,\
    \ etc. I simply want this ideology to be accepted. Peace is very important to\
    \ me as I see its potential all around. So, if you've made it this far and want\
    \ to help the world, share this message in your own words. It won't solve all\
    \ of the worlds problems, but it'll help a little.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\
    \n[Final, final note]: This post was about the social aspect of peace and while\
    \ it fails to account for its effectiveness on sociopaths, I believe that that's\
    \ a difference worth ignoring since ordinary methods of peace don't work on them,\
    \ anyway (except for Justice keeping them from harming others, of course). I understand\
    \ that peace has many aspects including technology, abundance of food, health\
    \ of the average person, etc. However, I figured those other aspects weren't worth\
    \ discussing since patch-work is already on the way to fill in those holes due\
    \ to the amazing strides of science."

  selftext: "I had a really interesting exchange with Chomsky on free will recently.\
    \ I thought I'd share it here.\n\n******\n\nMe:\nHi, Mr. Chomsky. The people who\
    \ don't believe we have free will often make this point: \n\n\"Let's say we turned\
    \ back time to a specific decision that you made. You couldn't have done otherwise;\
    \ the universe, your body, your brain, the particles in your brain, were in such\
    \ a condition that your decision was going to happen. At that very moment you\
    \ made the decision, all the neurons were in such a way that it had to happen.\
    \ And this all applies to the time leading up to the decision as well. In other\
    \ words, you don't have free will. Your \"self\", the control you feel that you\
    \ have, is an illusion made up by neurons, synapses etc. that are in such a way\
    \ that everything that happens in your brain is forced.\" \n\nWhat is wrong with\
    \ this argument?\n\n\nNoam Chomsky:\nIt begs the question: it assumes that all\
    \ that exists is determinacy and randomness, but that is exactly what is in question.\
    \ It also adds the really outlandish assumption that we know that neurons are\
    \ the right place to look. That\u2019s seriously questioned, even within current\
    \ brain science.\n\nMe:\nOkay, but whatever it is that's causing us to make decisions,\
    \ wasn't it in such a way that the decision was forced? So forget neurons and\
    \ synapses, take the building blocks of the universe, then (strings or whatever\
    \ they are), aren't they in such a condition that you couldn't have acted in a\
    \ different way? Everything is physical, right? So doesn't the argument still\
    \ stand?\n\nNoam Chomsky:\nThe argument stands if we beg the only serious question,\
    \ and assume that the actual elements of the universe are restricted to determinacy\
    \ and randomness. If so, then there is no free will, contrary to what everyone\
    \ believes, including those who write denying that there is free will \u2013 a\
    \ pointless exercise in interaction between two thermostats, where both action\
    \ and response are predetermined (or random).\n\n********\nAs you know, Chomsky\
    \ spends a lot of time answering tons of mail, so he has limited time to spend\
    \ on each question; if he were to write and article on this, it would obviously\
    \ be more thorough than this. But this was still really interesting, I think:\
    \ What if randomness and determinacy are not the full picture? It seems to me\
    \ that many have debated free will without taking into account that there might\
    \ be other phenomena out there that fit neither randomness nor determinacy.. \n"

    \ as Paul R\xE9e is still of great relevance today). Yet belief in the Christian\
    \ God, which stood at the centre of this world-view, has since crumbled, leading\
    \ many to question their received categories of Good and Evil.\n\nIn \u2018On\
    \ the Genealogy of Morality\u2019, Nietzsche paints a vivid portrait of a very\
    \ different kind of ethical life: an older tradition of thought and practice that\
    \ flourished in Ancient Greece and Rome, and which was\ncharacterised by reverence\
    \ for strength, nobility, independence, and success in battle. By inviting us\
    \ to view our own moral standpoint from a detached perspective, he encourages\
    \ us to bring its key assumptions into question. Whether or not one ultimately\
    \ agrees with Nietzsche that our current moral valuations are standing in the\
    \ way of humankind's true greatness, this enquiry is one that is well worth engaging\
    \ in.\n\nMy name is Don Berry, and I received my PhD from University College London.\
    \ I also have an Ma in mathematics from Cambridge and recently wrote an extensive,\
    \ peer-reviewed analysis of \u201COn the Genealogy of Morality\u201D for Macat.\
    \ My current research lies at the intersection of ethics and biology. I am interested\
    \ in Greek virtue ethics and in what science has to say about the good life for\
    \ human beings, looking to biology and other related disciplines to give this\
    \ notion a fuller grounding that emerges as a matter of objective fact.\nAll of\
    \ these ideas have been sharply criticised by Friedrich Nietzsche, my greatest\
    \ antagonist.\n\nI will be online Friday, 4th December starting at 1030 EST/1530\
    \ GMT till 1830 EST/2330 GMT.\n\n**You can find the AMA post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/3veon1/im_don_berry_phd_university_college_london_here/)**\n\
    \nLooking forward to the discussion!\n"

  selftext: "Consider again the paradox,\n\n*\u201CA judge tells a condemned prisoner\
    \ that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that\
    \ the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. He will not know the day of\
    \ the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.*\n\
    \n\n*Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that\
    \ he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several parts. He begins\
    \ by concluding that the \"surprise hanging\" can't be on Friday, as if he hasn't\
    \ been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left - and so it won't be a surprise\
    \ if he's hanged on Friday. Since the judge's sentence stipulated that the hanging\
    \ would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday.*\n\n\n*He\
    \ then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, because\
    \ Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't been hanged by Wednesday\
    \ night, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday hanging not a surprise\
    \ either. By similar reasoning he concludes that the hanging can also not occur\
    \ on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that\
    \ the hanging will not occur at all.\"*\n\n\n*The next week, the executioner knocks\
    \ on the prisoner's door at noon on Wednesday \u2014 which, despite all the above,\
    \ was an utter surprise to him. Everything the judge said came true.\u201D*\n\n\
    **The prisoners logic fails due to the direction of time.  Since time flows from\
    \ Monday to Friday the sequence of events, as the judge intended them, on Monday\
    \ is:**\n\n\nMonday:\n\n1. Knock on Door.\n\n2. Then Realization that the hanging\
    \ will occur.\n\n3. Then Realization of Surprise due to the hanging.\n\nOn the\
    \ contrary the prisoners deduction makes a determination about surprise before\
    \ the determination of hanging.\n\nFriday: \n\n1. No Surprise \n2. No Hanging\n\
    \n\nThursday: \n\n1. No Surprise \n2. No Hanging\n\n\nWednesday: \n\n\n1. No Surprise\
    \ \n2. No Hanging\n\n\nTuesday: \n\n\n1. No Surprise \n2. No Hanging\n\n\nMonday:\n\
    \n\n1. No Surprise \n2. No Hanging\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn the given day of the hanging.\n\
    \nThe Prisoner:\n\n1. No surprise\n2. Thus no hanging\n\nThe Judge:\n\n1. Hanging\n\
    2. Thus surprise\n\nSo it is the faulty premise that you could disprove surprise\
    \ first that leads to the paradox of being surprised.  \n\n\nIf time did not have\
    \ a direction and/or allowed for simultaneity then the prisoners logic would be\
    \ sound.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis amounts to the prisoner and judge having a misunderstanding.\n\
    \n\nWhat the prisoner thinks the judge means:\n\nWhen I have surprised the prisoner\
    \ he will be hanged.\n\nWhat the judge thinks the judge means.\n\nWhen I inform\
    \ the prisoner he will be hanged it will make the prisoner surprised.\n\nWhat\
    \ will actually happen:\n\nWhen I tell the prisoner he will be hanged he is going\
    \ to be surprised (or maybe not surprised)?\n\nAgain thanks to user ughaibu for\
    \ helping flush this out in the discussion of my previous post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

  selftext: "Until recently, I\u2019ve been something of a nihilist. I believed that\
    \ there was no objective meaning to life, so it was up to each person to choose\
    \ and pursue their own purpose. After running a few calculations comparing various\
    \ estimates of [existential risk]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risks),\
    \ my position has shifted slightly. (*existential* here means threats to our existence,\
    \ not the risk of having an existential crisis) I now believe that preserving\
    \ the future of humanity is ~~intrinsically~~instrumentally valuable, because\
    \ of our potential to investigate and promote activities which may one day lead\
    \ to us discovering an objective meaning to life.\n\nThis isn\u2019t bulletproof,\
    \ because it requires a number of leaps of faith. First, we must assert \u201C\
    I think therefore I am\u201D and all the other usual assumptions that we make\
    \ when we declare that the world exists at all. Besides those, we only need a\
    \ few additional assertions:\n\n* Some things are intrinsically valuable/desirable/good/moral/meaningful.\n\
    \n* If humans discover this intrinsic value, we will then promote it.\n\n* It\
    \ is possible that someday humans may discover this intrinsic value.\n\n* The\
    \ greatest contribution to this search can be made by preserving the species,\
    \ so that future generations can participate in the search. (As a side note, advancing\
    \ scientific knowledge seems to me to be a close second.)\n\nThis conveniently\
    \ circumnavigates all the complicated aspects of trying to define an objective\
    \ morality, and avoids all the additional assumptions made in the process. At\
    \ the same time, it is extremely practical (at least compared to trying to weigh\
    \ all possible actions, in order to do the greatest good for the greatest number\
    \ of people in the long run). Can you guys help me find the flaws in this argument,\
    \ or suggest any philosophers with similar ideas?\n\nThe 4^th assertion seems\
    \ to me to be the week point, because it relies on the findings of only a handful\
    \ of existential risk researchers. Mature fields like physics, biology, and economics\
    \ are much better at predicting the outcome of certain human actions, but existential\
    \ risk research is a fledgling field, and only has a small handful of papers published.\
    \ Regardless, justifying the 4^th assertion is much more of a pragmatic engineering\
    \ problem than an abstract philosophical one. Obviously it needs justification\
    \ though, so I\u2019m quarantining my justification in a comment below. Hopefully\
    \ that will let us keep any discussion that may happen on topic."

  selftext: "I have always thought about how skepticism fits into politics. Let's\
    \ take a complex political question like taxation, or healthcare, or education\
    \ reform, and call this political issue A. Political issue A has an infinite number\
    \ of ways to address the issue, and many external variables influencing the issue,\
    \ which makes it difficult to understand, make policies about, and even be sure\
    \ that our policies made the situation better or worse. My argument goes something\
    \ like this:\n\n1) Truly understanding political issue A would take me a lifetime\
    \ of schooling and professional experience to truly understand. \n2) There are\
    \ people who have devoted to their lives to understanding political issue A, and\
    \ likely some with analytical abilities at least as strong as mine, who have come\
    \ to opposite conclusions regarding political issue A.\n3) Conclusion: I, who\
    \ have not devoted my life to understanding political issue A, should not claim\
    \ knowledge of political issue A, and should not judge others for having beliefs\
    \ different from mine.\n\nI am not claiming that I cannot have beliefs about these\
    \ types of political issues, but that I should not claim to know them and should\
    \ remain open to alternatives to my belief. I am also aware that my argument is\
    \ not logically rigorous, but more of a sketch.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the great\
    \ responses. I think a great counter-position (see u/TorsionFree and u/take5b)\
    \ is the view that political disagreements are mostly about values, which do not\
    \ take a lifetime to understand and which are presumably fairly easy to implement\
    \ into policy if we could all agree on what values are correct and which ones\
    \ take precedence in different issues. However, I would make two counter arguments.\
    \ First, I think given a fixed set of values, the implementation step of creating\
    \ policy is a non-trivial process which the argument above would apply to. I believe\
    \ many thinkers agree to a large extent on the values but differ in the best implementation\
    \ through policy. And slight changes in how much weight we give to each value\
    \ can result in very different implementations (for example privacy vs security\
    \ in government security programs). Secondly, I think we may have simply moved\
    \ the epistemological burden of proof to our values rather than the implementation\
    \ of our values through policy. If political disagreements rely on disagreements\
    \ in values, how we do justify our position vs. another? If our position is that\
    \ privacy is more important than security, for example, is there any way we can\
    \ ever claim this is the 'right' moral/political view? I think it's much more\
    \ rigorous to claim that political values and views are subjective beliefs based\
    \ on subjective values, and we should treat them as such. That is not to say we\
    \ cannot defend, lobby for, vote for, or espouse a political position, but only\
    \ that we might not have any more evidence than the next guy.    "

  selftext: "I very often sense a strange social edge in the defenders of determinism:\
    \ it implies that no one has really deserved or earned anything, or is to be blamed\
    \ for anything. And from this would somehow follow an entire social utopia: income\
    \ redistributed by need because no one ever really earned their money, punishing\
    \ criminals would be wrong now and so on. The fallacy should be obvious, but apparently\
    \ I need to spell it out: the sword of determinism implying no moral blame cuts\
    \ both ways.\n\nIf under determinism a criminal cannot be blamed for a crime,\
    \ I also cannot be blamed for wanting a punishment anyway. If people haven't earned\
    \ their income or cannot be called non deserving of assistance, people also cannot\
    \ be morally blamed for the selfishness of not being interested in helping others\
    \ at all or wanting to keep nearly all their income to themselves.\n\nIndeed,\
    \ I wonder if there is a hidden appeal to popularity there: while under determinism\
    \ being vengeful, being selfish or uninterested in helping others would not be\
    \ morally blameworthy, they likely would still likely be unpopular and not a good\
    \ way to win a social debate or get votes.\n\nHowever, the truly important aspect\
    \ is that even if determinism does not make people blameworthy (value judgement),\
    \ it does not in itself deny the claim that treating people as if they were blameworthy\
    \ or treating people the usual common ways that are usually justified by moral\
    \ blame is likely to lead to desirable outcomes (factual claim).\n\nTo put it\
    \ a bit more precisely, determinism does not in itself deny that practical effects\
    \ like punishment can deter people from criminality, having much ones income taken\
    \ away can deter one from working hard, or getting a generous public assistance\
    \ without doing anything may discincentivize one from working. In fact, I could\
    \ even argue that determinism **makes this even more likelier, because without\
    \ free will there is one reason less to assume incentives are not automatically,\
    \ causally, deterministically followed**. \n\nIndeed, there is another hidden\
    \ appeal to popularity here. Modern people and especially Americans have a certain\
    \ tendency to have really high more ideals. For example, they react to even minor\
    \ cruelty to animals with revulsion. The point is, under determinism someone could\
    \ argue that punishing a criminal is not inherently just anymore (no moral blame)\
    \ but it still works for deterrence, then people with high moral ideals would\
    \ simply find it morally unacceptable to make people suffer even if it leads to\
    \ good outcomes, but is not inherently deserved. It is likely that undeserved\
    \ suffering would be unpopular even when helpful. Roughly the same can be said\
    \ about income redistribution and many similar matters. \n\nIn short then, the\
    \ reason there is an apparent connection between determinism and social utopianism\
    \ is based on that we live in an age where people have very high moral ideals,\
    \ they are unlikely to accept suffering just because it is utilitarian,  just\
    \ because it is practically useful. They only accept suffering if it is just,\
    \ deserved. Thus the social utopian by killing desert can hope that that the overwhelming\
    \ majority will support a \"to each according to their need\" and not incentive-oriented\
    \ policy.\n\nThis bothers me, because I am a determinist but not a social utopian.\
    \ I would really prefer if determinism could be embedded in a rather cold and\
    \ cynical sounding \"incentive engineer\" attitude, meting out precisely measured\
    \ suffering and pleasure, i.e. punishment and reward, i.e. incentives that deterministically\
    \ change human behavior for the better. (Not necessarily the current ones - maybe\
    \ we need entirely different incentives against crime than prisons, entirely different\
    \ incentives to work than hunger, but that could be determined empirically which\
    \ incentive works best). It is precisely through becoming a determinist does one\
    \ realize how much moralism can suck.  So I really dislike that determinism is\
    \ used for social utopianism, because it rests precisely on that popular and entirely\
    \ wrong notion that in the absence of justice and deserts and blame, needs i.e.\
    \ the morality of compassion become the most important considerations. No, they\
    \ don't, because humans aren't passive sufferers and enjoyers but active doers\
    \ and thus suffering and enjoyment should only be important from the viewpoint\
    \ of what behavior it motivates. As active beings, only behavior and results should\
    \ matter. Seeing us as passive consumers of pain and pleasure really sells us\
    \ short, thus we should care about what others do and not about their pain and\
    \ pleasure. If I think you should go to the doctor, I am going to be glad instead\
    \ of sad if pain motivates (causes) you to do so. "

  selftext: "#Life Sucks \u2013 A defense of philosophical pessimism#\n\n##Introduction##\n\
    \nLeibniz famously proclaimed that this was the best of all possible worlds in\
    \ order to solve the problem of evil.\n\nA century later, Schopenhauer would argue\
    \ the opposite: this is one of the worst of all possible worlds, permeated with\
    \ suffering, decay, and death, in which everything is an incarnation of the insidious\
    \ Will.\n\nFor the average reader, the adjectives used may seem accurate, but\
    \ the proclamation that the world is so poor would be taken as an exaggeration.\
    \ It is in this post that I try to argue in favor of Schopenhauer\u2019s, and\
    \ his fellow pessimists\u2019, lament of the world.\n\n##Suffering##\n\nFirst,\
    \ I would like to define what suffering is. Suffering is any irredeemable discomfort\
    \ across a spectrum of feeling. By \u201Cirredeemable\u201D, I mean \u201Cunable\
    \ to bring meaning out of\u201D, as in pointless, defeating, and burdensome. Physical\
    \ pain often accompanies suffering, but it not necessary (i.e. psychological suffering).\n\
    \nNow, it is plainly obvious that there is suffering in the world. There is discomfort,\
    \ oftentimes quite severe. It is my belief that what makes something of ethical\
    \ value is its ability to feel suffering, and that our ethical impetus should\
    \ be to address the existence of suffering.\n\nThere is no doubt that quite a\
    \ lot of discomfort can be redeemed in a meaningful way. Climbing a mountain may\
    \ be extremely strenuous, but worth it in the end.\n\nHowever, there is a problem\
    \ here. The meaningfulness of this discomfort is *post hoc*. If anyone would willingly\
    \ take discomfort over neutral or pleasant feelings, they would be a masochist.\n\
    \nTherefore, the world is filled with unnecessary discomfort.\n\n##Boredom##\n\
    \nBut what if we lived in a world without discomfort? This is where the second\
    \ part of Schopenhauer\u2019s assessment of the world comes into play: boredom.\n\
    \nMy argument is that existence as we know it is a pendulum that swings back and\
    \ forth between suffering and boredom. If we are not suffering, we are either\
    \ in a brief intern (a relief which I take to be happiness), or bored out of our\
    \ minds.\n\nExperience makes certain slices of reality more vibrant, whether that\
    \ is pleasurable sex or a miserable root canal. Our attention is focused on what\
    \ is happening, beneficial or detrimental.\n\nBut when you are bored, reality\
    \ begins to become a heavy, stagnant burden. There is no stimulus. Your consciousness\
    \ is desperately reaching out, trying to find something to keep you occupied.\
    \ My claim is that life is a literal waste of time; every single thing we do is\
    \ a distraction to keep us from confronting the void of boredom. Weltschmerz becomes\
    \ very evident if you are ever bored for a significant amount of time.\n\n##Pleasure##\n\
    \nBut what about pleasure? Isn\u2019t it rather odd to focus only on the negative?\n\
    \nI am not denying that pleasure is \u201Cpsychological beneficial\u201D. Rather,\
    \ I am claiming that pleasure is intermediate, temporary, and ultimately unsatisfying.\
    \ The Buddhist concept of *tanha* explains this: certain kinds of pleasure are\
    \ like addictions; after using up your supply of pleasure, you are back on to\
    \ the hedonic treadmill. Evolution did not program us to be happy, it programmed\
    \ us to be motivated. Furthermore, a simple introspective activity will lead to\
    \ the conclusion that pleasure is far less \u201Creal\u201D than pain. A simply\
    \ pinprick can hurt like hell, while all the chocolate in the world is not orgasmic\
    \ (in fact, too much pleasure can lead to discomfort).\n\n##Consciousness##\n\n\
    My conception of happiness is one that makes it equivalent to contentedness. If\
    \ you do not desire anything, you are content. You do not feel any anxiety, any\
    \ pang, for stimulus. You are at peace. Like Schopenhauer, I argue that to be\
    \ content not only requires you to limit your desires but also to be free of suffering.\
    \ Again, not all pain is equivalent to suffering; for example, I could have a\
    \ headache and still feel generally happy. This does, however, show how easy it\
    \ is for happiness to break. Happiness is a very fragile thing, held together\
    \ by threads of pleasure, contentedness, attention, and ignorance. The default\
    \ position of human consciousness is that of striving, discomfort, and dissatisfaction.\n\
    \nAs Zapffe argued, I hold that consciousness is ultimately a burden, a curse\
    \ that evolution bestowed upon us. We have become too smart, too observant. The\
    \ human mind has aspirations that the universe cannot fulfill. Unlike many ancient\
    \ Greeks who thought that rationality would lead to happiness and flourishing,\
    \ the pessimist affirms the opposite. Rationality has exposed the nature of reality,\
    \ and it is not pretty. It could be argued that pessimism is a philosophy of disillusionment.\n\
    \ \nZapffe also argued that humans \u201Cartificially limit\u201D their consciousness.\
    \ To be conscious, at least in the human sense, is to have to ability to suffer,\
    \ feel boredom, and come to the meta-conclusion that this is what the consequences\
    \ of consciousness are. Humans will often escape the panic of this realization\
    \ by sublimating their thought process, thus the creation of culture, political\
    \ ideology, religion, aesthetics, etc. In this way, we avoid the panic of realizing\
    \ how empty our lives really are and become addicted to a fantasy.\n\n##Solutions##\n\
    \nWhat I have written is not a comforting picture of the world. But there is no\
    \ limit to what philosophy can explore, even if it makes us uncomfortable. \n\n\
    There are some paths we can take to deal with all of this. I deny that these are\
    \ mutually exclusive.\n\nThe first path is to rebel. Nietzsche and Camus come\
    \ to mind. I have sympathies to both of them, but I think Nietzsche went too far.\
    \ His *amor fati* is not only impossible, but masochistic. Camus was far more\
    \ tempered and realistic; his Sisyphean philosophy is one that can be applied\
    \ to an unstable, nihilistic world without radically changing the structure of\
    \ it.\n\nOn the topic of Nietzsche: his Ubermensch appeals to our desire for victory,\
    \ dominance, and flourishing. But I deny that one cannot become an Ubermensch\
    \ if one lives a \u201Cnihilistic life\u201D as Nietzsche would say. I deny that\
    \ such paths as the Middle Path of Buddhism are \u201Cincompatible\u201D with\
    \ Nietzsche\u2019s overman concept. In fact, if we were to take to the path of\
    \ the overman without conceding the wisdom of the classic pessimists such as the\
    \ Buddha and Schopenhauer, we will only be setting ourselves up for inevitable\
    \ defeat and non-stop suffering. Nietzsche claims that the overman would be able\
    \ to embrace this; I claim this is psychologically impossible and masochistic.\n\
    \nThe second path is to pursue asceticism. Asceticism is a difficult word to pin\
    \ down, but basically what I claim asceticism is, in this context, is the path\
    \ that rejects the world as it is. The ascetic realizes that meaningless pleasure\
    \ is only fuel for an addiction; although it feels good, it is ultimately a very\
    \ bad thing. The ascetic realizes that the ego is the microcosm of the world and\
    \ the structure of suffering; thereby denying the ego, they attempt to deny themselves\
    \ suffering.\n \nInterestingly, if we are to take the Buddha\u2019s philosophy\
    \ seriously, then much of the suffering imposed upon us is self-caused (by ignorance,\
    \ aversion, and attachment).\n\nNotice how the first two paths deal with the more\
    \ \u201Cexistential\u201D burdens of life. But there are still very real, very\
    \ harsh physical pains, that cannot be tempered by mere psychological perspectives.\
    \ Tomorrow I might get a raise, but then again, I might get into a car accident\
    \ and be impaled and die a horribly painful death (which is obviously irredeemable).\
    \ Depending on your ability to deal with your current existential condition, alongside\
    \ the perceived probability of something of the aforementioned magnitude of happening,\
    \ the rational path may be suicide. Perhaps suicide is indeed the rational choice\
    \ for everyone, since the future cannot be predicted, and you won\u2019t know\
    \ of any pleasures you have missed if you are dead.\n\nI doubt the ability of\
    \ technology to solve these problems. It is far more reasonable to assume that\
    \ these technologies will be perverted and cause even more suffering, as is the\
    \ case in a significant amount of technological advances in the past.\n\nMy personal\
    \ philosophy on this is that regardless of whether or not we like this perspective,\
    \ we are programmed to continue to live. Unless we are in such significant, traumatic\
    \ suffering, we cannot kill ourselves. It is biologically impossible. So the solution\
    \ is to minimize what suffering we do experience, maximize our pleasure and happiness,\
    \ and ultimately live a life that, when it comes to die, leaves us with the knowledge\
    \ that it was worth it. It would be quite sad to look back at your life and wish\
    \ you had killed yourself earlier, whereas, if you look back at your life and\
    \ come away knowing that, against all the odds, you managed to make your life\
    \ meaningful and worth it, that would constitute a \"good life\" in my book (even\
    \ if it's not worth it to start a life).\n\nIt goes without saying, however, that\
    \ regardless of which path you take (or lack thereof) there is no excuse to inflict\
    \ harm upon another sentient being (unless by self-defense). This includes procreation,\
    \ or as I tend to view it, destructive breeding. When one realizes that each and\
    \ every sentient being is a fellow sufferer, then it is quite easy to see how\
    \ compassion should be used to assess our relationships between other people.\
    \ \n\n##TL;DR: As Thomas Ligotti said, \u201CLIFE IS MALIGNANTLY USELESS.\u201D\
    ##\n\nCheers.\n\nEDIT: some edits and a few little additions here and there.\n\

  selftext: "It occurs to me that several themes in popular thought over the last\
    \ couple of decades can be analyzed from the standpoint of [James Conant's Cartesian/Kantian\
    \ distinction in skeptical problematics](http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/conant/Conant%202012%20Two%20Varieties%20of%20Skepticism.pdf).\
    \ My thought isn't that people are turning into radical global skeptics, just\
    \ that many views seem to be coming from skeptical thoughts. Michael Williams\
    \ suggests the same in his intro to epistemology (Problems of Knowledge, 2001,\
    \ p10):\n\n>Although, when its implications are fully understood, philosophical\
    \ scepticism is difficult--maybe impossible--to swallow, sceptical ideas are enormously\
    \ influential in contemporary culture, which is characterized by pervasive and\
    \ deeply felt misgivings about rationality, justification, and truth. Sceptical\
    \ ideas, I believe, underpin such widely accepted doctrines as 'social constructivism',\
    \ according to which what people believe is wholly a function of social, institutional,\
    \ and political influences, so that 'reason' is only the mask of power; relativism,\
    \ which says that things are only 'true for' a particular person or 'culture';\
    \ and 'standpoint epistemologies', according to which social differentiation by\
    \ gender, race, class, or tribe gives rise to distinct 'ways of knowing', there\
    \ being no possibility of justification according to common standards.\n\nFor\
    \ example, there are few more ubiquitous kernels of popular wisdom than the denial\
    \ of absolute truth. Does it sound as familiar to you as it does to me to come\
    \ at this idea from roughly these two angles: \n\n* One, if there were any truth\
    \ higher than my truth or truth-for-me, how could I know? For any purported truth,\
    \ either it conforms to my contingent, subjective version of truth, or it doesn't.\
    \ If, in addition, it either conformed or failed to conform to some higher standard\
    \ detached from me, how could I tell, since I am locked within my world, the world-as-it-is-for-me?\
    \ Surely no matter how certain I am that a particular truth holds irrespective\
    \ of me, that appearance is always consistent with that truth holding only for\
    \ me. \n\n* And two, what would it even mean for there to *be* absolute truth?\
    \ In what real sense can we call something true if it isn't even true for any\
    \ of us? What meaning can we give to the idea of something that is true in the\
    \ world but not true in anybody's world?\n\nThe first angle is Cartesian skepticism\
    \ about absolute truth, the second is Kantian. Or take the parallel twin problematic\
    \ concerning free will:\n\n* First, with any action performed by someone else,\
    \ how do I know that action flows from their free will? Maybe they are mind-controlled,\
    \ under duress, mentally compromised, etc. Furthermore, how do I know that my\
    \ own actions are freely willed? How do I know that I am acting of my own free\
    \ will right now and am not simply going through the motions like an automaton?\
    \ Is there any experience of acting or observing someone else act that I could\
    \ have which would be inconsistent with all freedom being a mere illusion?\n\n\
    * And second, what would it even take for an action to be freely willed in the\
    \ first place? Is the idea even intelligible? Wouldn't it, for example, require\
    \ an absurd suspension of both determinism and indeterminism? How could particles\
    \ and chemicals in mechanistic motion be free? Etc.\n\nMuch of this sounds like\
    \ the scientistic attack on free will. \n\nI've been having thoughts along these\
    \ lines for a few days. It seems a lot of places I look there are views as to\
    \ the non-existence of some big important thing -- \"quining\" views -- that are\
    \ understandable as motivated by this sort of conjunction of foundational epistemological\
    \ and semantico-ontological worries. I think it's important to see that Cartesian\
    \ and Kantian skepticism are not the only ways of being skeptical of a thing or\
    \ arguing against its existence. You can argue that something is implausible in\
    \ a lot of ways, but Conant seems to me to want to capture these big types of\
    \ cases where our doubts are driven by a sense of not understanding how something\
    \ is even possible in principle, either knowledge of the thing or the thing itself.\
    \ Just this form of doubt seems to be driving some popular trains of thought,\
    \ for example:\n\n* Scientistic reductionism; the doubts are about irreducibility.\
    \ (I think, to many scientismists, a reduction base feels like not just a plausible\
    \ metaphysical constraint but an indispensable precondition of comprehensibility\
    \ on any phenomenon.) The Kantian worry is easy to see here, but here's where\
    \ I locate the Cartesian one: *If* there were a case of genuine irreducibility,\
    \ how could we tell? Perhaps the successful reduction is just yet to be performed.\
    \ After all any number of failed reductions is consistent with the principled\
    \ reducibility of a thing. Most parsimoniously we should assume an undiscovered\
    \ reduction base rather than a non-existent one; indeed this is necessary for\
    \ our scientific-explanatory purposes. \n\n* Scientistic naturalism; the doubts\
    \ are about the supernatural, paranormal, psychic, etc. The parallel to the reductionism\
    \ case is very close: If there were ever a case of genuine supernaturalty, how\
    \ could we tell? After all, any number of failed natural explanations is consistent\
    \ with... Most parsimoniously we should assume an undiscovered natural explanation\
    \ rather than a supernatural one...\n\n* Widespread popular anti-objectivity sentiments\
    \ in ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, as well as social/political philosophy\
    \ (think about certain pop philosophical or spiritual attitudes towards money,\
    \ borders, etc.).\n\n* Metaphysical idealism within contemporary popular spirituality.\n\
    \n* No-self views within contemporary popular spirituality.\n\nMore examples have\
    \ occurred to me, and in more detail, but these are the contours of the thought.\
    \ I'm not sure what else to do with it for now."

    with the political position of the same name! -- hold that determinism is not
    true, and we do have free will; they are also incompatibilists.


    Here determinism is understood as [causal determinism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/):
    "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions
    together with the laws of nature." Free will is understood as that which is necessary
    for moral responsibility. (I know defining free will is somewhat controversial
    here, so feel free to call this a *stipulated* definition and watch carefully
    to make sure that I use it consistently!) We will assume for the purposes of this
    argument that determinism is true.


    First, let us suppose that we are responsible for some action only in the case
    that we, in fact, chose to do it, and we were not *forced* to choose in this way
    by someone or something external to us. Differently put: if we make a choice,
    but it turns out we were forced to make this choice by someone or something else,
    then we can''t be blamed or praised for that choice.


    The incompatibilist seems at first to have a solid objection to free will on this
    basis. They might say: well, if you chose to do X, this is just to say that a
    whole bunch of prior causes -- your genes, your environment, etc. -- together
    necessitated your doing it. So, since determinism is true, you are not morally
    responsible for anything.


    This initially looks like a solid case, but seems less so if we closely examine
    what, exactly, the "you" is here: the nature of people, in the sense of being
    things which make choices. In order to say that you are forced to act by prior
    causes, we have to say that these causes are external to you. But that doesn''t
    always seem to be the case. If we suppose determinism is true, then you *just
    are* the sum total of a whole bunch of prior causes: all the genetic and environmental
    factors that caused you to have certain beliefs, values, desires, and so on. So
    if you choose, we cannot suppose that these force you to choose. These things
    are intrinsic to and constitutive of you, not external to you.


    The alternative seems to be to say: no, you are not the sum total of these kinds
    of prior causes. You are either some sort of thing which *doesn''t have* beliefs,
    values, desires, and so on, or you do have those, but you didn''t get them from
    prior causes. You are a thing which is separate from this causal-deterministic
    order, and those things are therefore external to you, and they therefore force
    you to make choices. But this seems to be a quintessentially *libertarian* view
    of the self, in that it must propose a "self" separate from causation. Since we
    are assuming determinism is true, this won''t work.


    So: we are, given determinism, the sum total of all these prior causes, and therefore
    they do not force us to choose (because they *are* us), and therefore we are responsible
    for our actions... and therefore we do have free will.


    Of course, in this account, it seems that we don''t *always* have freedom to choose.
    Some prior causes do seem to be external to us. If I inject a probe into your
    brain and stimulate certain neurons or whatever, and this causes you to do something,
    then this is hardly a belief, value, desire, or anything else which is intrinsic
    to you. But this is not to say that we don''t have free will, but just that there
    are certain situations in which our freedom to choose can be compromised. In such
    cases, we are not morally responsible for the outcome.

    The above link goes through several major approaches to moral philosophy (utilitarianism,
    rights, virtue, etc.), and shows that each implies that we ought to treat animals
    much better than we do now.  This is a nice case of apparent progress and agreement
    in moral philosophy: even if we''re uncertain which is the "true" moral theory,
    there is good reason to believe that consistent application of *any* of our moral
    theories means taking animal interests much more seriously.  In particular, most
    moral theories seem to point to factory farming and much of animal experimentation
    being unjustified.'

  selftext: 'I haven''t made much of a study of philosophy, but my own cognitive dissonance
    is bothering me with this question, and I''d appreciate an introduction to these
    topics.  My thinking is like this:


    If my dog were suffering near the end of her life, I''d euthanize her. If my young
    child were suffering near the end of his life, I wouldn''t euthanize him. This
    strikes me as inconsistent because I love both, and I''m the acting agent for
    both, but I''d act differently.


    Similarly, I''d consider it morally wrong to knowingly breed a dog with genetic
    problems that could impact it''s quality of life. However, I wouldn''t consider
    it morally wrong to have children if you carry genes that could impact their quality
    of life.  I rationalize this by thinking dogs depend on a finite resource of human
    caretakers for quality of life, and a sick dog diminishes the greatest potential
    quality in the big picture, but I don''t acknowledge a similar constraint for
    human happiness. Is this inconsistent since humans also share finite resources
    among themselves?


    Is there an argument about humans not being morally able to act as agents for
    other humans that cleans this up? Has it been argued that societies are super
    organisms of humans, similar to humans being super organisms of single celled
    life, and so society should act as caretakers for humans the way humans act as
    caretakers for other lesser organisms?


    Which cans of worms do I need to eat first?'

  selftext: "Considering how relatively rarely Chinese philosophy makes it big here,\
    \ I simply have to correct that terribly written article about Daoism and the\
    \ 'trolley' thought experiment. \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1doab8/to_a_daoist_the_trolley_problem_is_not_a_problem/\n\
    \nThe article is total misinterpretation of Daoism, mistranslates Daoist concepts,\
    \ and is all in all terribly short-sighted and gives only a surface explanation\
    \ to Daoist philosophy.\n\nFirstly, it's important to remember that the Daodejing\
    \ is first and foremost a political book - it describes how to best run a state/organise\
    \ a society. So, to say a Daoist wouldn't care about the trolley problem should\
    \ seem instantly sketchy, seeming as Daoist writers wrote an entire book about\
    \ how to care for society.    \n\nSecondly *wu wei* does not literally mean 'non-action',\
    \ but is best understood as 'no **unnatural** action'. In The Daodejing, unnatural\
    \ action would be actions like warfare, or overly high taxes. These were seen\
    \ as unnatural because they overtly interfered in the daily lives of the common\
    \ people, making their lives more difficult and more complicated. Political Daoism\
    \ is concerned with making the common people more spontaneous (*ziran*) so they\
    \ can better follow the *dao* (way). Following the *dao* would supposedly bring\
    \ a level of happiness and prosperity to society (again, showing direct, worldly\
    \ concern for human beings). \n\nThirdly, the example from The *Zhuangzi*, where\
    \ Zhuangzi cries when his wife dies but then is oddly fine with it has nothing\
    \ to do with the trolley example. Zhuangzi is happy quickly after his wife's death\
    \ because he realises death is a natural, unavoidable part of life. However, just\
    \ because he is ok with death doesn't mean he would allow his wife to die on a\
    \ train track. Obviously he would save his wife that he loved, and this would\
    \ be quite a 'natural' (*wu wei* compatible) action.\n\nSo, IMHO, the Daoist would\
    \ save the group at the expense of the single person. That being said, it is true\
    \ that Daoists were aware that 'you never know what will happen' (i.e. one of\
    \ that group might be the next Hitler). But, the fact remains that even if we\
    \ disagree over this final point, the idea that the Daoist wouldn't care because\
    \ he believes in 'non-action' is just ridiculous. "

  selftext: "**Thank you so much for hosting us. We have greatly enjoyed the discussion\
    \ and stayed on well past when we planned to be here - it was just so exciting\
    \ to hear your thoughts. We're sorry we have to get going now but we will try\
    \ to answer the few remaining questions as time allows in the near future. Thank\
    \ you again for a fantastic discussion!**\n\nWhy is a course on ancient Chinese\
    \ philosophers one of the most popular at Harvard?\n\n\nIt\u2019s because the\
    \ course challenges all our modern assumptions about what it takes to flourish.\
    \ This is why Professor Michael Puett says to his students, \u201CThe encounter\
    \ with these ideas will change your life.\u201D As one of them told his collaborator,\
    \ author Christine Gross-Loh, \u201CYou can open yourself up to possibilities\
    \ you never imagined were even possible.\u201D\n\n\nThese astonishing teachings\
    \ emerged two thousand years ago through the work of a succession of Chinese scholars\
    \ exploring how humans can improve themselves and their society. And what are\
    \ these counterintuitive ideas? Good relationships come not from being sincere\
    \ and authentic, but from the rituals we perform within them. Influence comes\
    \ not from wielding power but from holding back. Excellence comes from what we\
    \ choose to do, not our natural abilities. A good life emerges not from planning\
    \ it out, but through training ourselves to respond well to small moments. Transformation\
    \ comes not from looking within for a true self, but from creating conditions\
    \ that produce new possibilities.\n\n\nIn other words, The Path upends everything\
    \ we are told about how to lead a good life. Above all, unlike most books on the\
    \ subject, its most radical idea is that there is no path to follow in the first\
    \ place\u2014just a journey we create anew at every moment by seeing and doing\
    \ things differently.\n\n\nSometimes voices from the past can offer possibilities\
    \ for thinking afresh about the future.\n\n**About the Authors:**\n\nMichael Puett\
    \ is the Walter C. Klein Professor of Chinese History in the Department of East\
    \ Asian Languages and Civilizations and Chair of the Committee on the Study of\
    \ Religion at Harvard University. He is the recipient of a Harvard College Professorship\
    \ for excellence in undergraduate teaching.\n\n\nChristine Gross-Loh is a freelance\
    \ journalist and author. Her writing has appeared in a number of publications\
    \ including *The Wall Street Journal*, *The Atlantic*, and the *Huffington Post*.\
    \ She has a PhD from Harvard University in East Asian history.\n\n\n**Links:**\n\

    are all the great learning resources that are posted. Over the past few years
    I have saved tons of resources to my evernote account and recently decided that

    which are the most highly acclaimed on reddit and other sites. Here is my philosophy

  selftext: "Hi, I'm new to Reddit.\n\nI've been working on a critique of the concept\
    \ of authority as part of my work to identify the root causes of chronic social\
    \ malignancies.\n\nTo date, social problems all seem to boil down to a question\
    \ of authoritarianism -- the commitment to the necessity and virtues of authority.\n\
    \nAs I've analyzed what authority is and how it works in practice, in actual fact\
    \ (there are oh-so-many fanciful ideas about how it's *supposed* to work that\
    \ just aren't borne out by facts and data) I'm realizing that the concept is literally\
    \ incoherent. I'm prepared to say it's irrational.\n\nThat's why I'd like to get\
    \ feedback from people here. I tried to engage people on Facebook, and it's been\
    \ valuable, but there's just too much uninformed noise there. A friend said that\
    \ I'd find a higher level of intelligent discussion here. So, here I am.\n\nThis\
    \ is all in development, so I don't have a cohesive critique ready yet. Working\
    \ on it. Bits and pieces for now.\n\nMy approach is provocative. The nut I'm trying\
    \ to crack involves entrenched, uncritically accepted assumptions that need to\
    \ be challenged. Although my thinking is logical and well-researched, I find that\
    \ a more confrontational approach is needed to get people to take a big enough\
    \ step back to even notice their assumptions. Then we can investigate them.\n\n\
    Here's one I'd love to get comments about. Thanks in advance! :)\n.\n.\n.\n\n\
    -----------------------\n\nHere's the Catch-22 all authority fails under:\n\n\
    If there is good reason to do something, a reasonable person will do it because\
    \ there is good reason to do it. So then, authority is unnecessary in their case.\n\
    \nIf there is good reason to not do something, a reasonable person will not do\
    \ it because there good reason not to do it. So then, again, authority is unnecessary\
    \ in their case.\n\nSo, authority is unnecessary in the case of reasonable people\
    \ when they act reasonably. Exercising authority over reasonable people acting\
    \ reasonably, then, would be unreasonable.\n\nThis is why I call on all reasonable\
    \ people to disregard authority. It doesn't apply to you.\n\nThe comeback to this,\
    \ of course, is the correct claim that not all people are reasonable, or that\
    \ reasonable people don't always behave reasonably. So, it goes, authority is\
    \ both necessary and reasonable when it comes to people who refuse to do what\
    \ there is good reason to do or insist on doing what there is good reason not\
    \ to do.\n\nI'm happy to dig into that one, and when I do, those who think the\
    \ argument will redeem the concept of authority will be sorely disappointed --\
    \ but one step at a time.\n\nTo begin with, let's consider the case of reasonable\
    \ people acting reasonably. Let's focus on that.\n\nLet's recognize that reasonable\
    \ people acting reasonably have no need for authority to ensure they behave reasonably.\
    \ And let's recognize the significant resistance we find everywhere to a logically\
    \ incontrovertible, well-evidenced rule in in favor of its exception. This bias\
    \ is itself unreasonable. \n\nThis admission is a big step.\n\nPeople are averse\
    \ to admitting these obvious facts. They knee-jerk the focus away from reasonable\
    \ people to set it on unreasonable people in an attempt to redeem the concept\
    \ of authority PRECISELY because *the concept is useless in the case of reasonable\
    \ people*. This is classic deflection.\n\nForcing a concept on cases where it\
    \ is useless under the belief that it's necessary is as close to irrational as\
    \ most things get.\n\nThis is just one reason why I maintain that the concept\
    \ of authority is irrational.\n\nWe'll get to other reasons in due course... :)\n\
    \n-------------\n\nEDIT: In response to the many concerns over \"reasonable\"\
    , I've changed:\n\n> So, authority is unnecessary in the case of reasonable people.\
    \ Exercising authority over reasonable people, then, would be unreasonable.\n\n\
    to: \n\n> So, authority is unnecessary in the case of reasonable people when they\
    \ act reasonably. Exercising authority over reasonable people acting reasonably,\
    \ then, would be unreasonable.\n\nI also changed:\n\n> The comeback to this, of\
    \ course, is the correct claim that not all people are reasonable. So, it goes,\
    \ authority is both necessary and reasonable when it comes to people who refuse\

    \ we still have going into our common sense the 19th century myth, which succeeded\
    \ the ceramic myth in Western history \u2013 I call it 'The Fully Automatic Model':\
    \ Man is a little germ that lives on an unimportant rock ball, that revolves about\
    \ an insignificant star on the outer edges of one of the smaller galaxies. But\

    \ is sort of intellectual yokel who gawks at things that sensible people take\
    \ for granted. And sensible people say, existence, it\u2019s nothing at all, just\
    \ go on and do something. See, this is the current movement in philosophy, 'logical\
    \ analysis', which says: you mustn\u2019t think about existence, it\u2019s a meaningless\
    \ concept. Therefore, philosophy has become the discussion of trivia. No good\
    \ philosopher lies awake nights, worrying about the destiny of Man, and the nature\

    \ 'does philosophy' during the day, which is discussing whether certain sentences\

    t know what question to ask when I wonder about the universe. It isn\u2019t a\
    \ question that I\u2019m wondering about, it\u2019s a feeling that I have...Because\
    \ I cannot formulate the question that is my wonder. The moment my mouth opens\
    \ to talk about it I suddenly find I\u2019m talking nonsense. But that should\
    \ not prevent wonder from being the foundation of philosophy.\" ~Alan Watts..."

    \ back to earth with the last 24 hours of your memory erased. Which do you choose?\
    \ It seems to me that there is really no difference between the two, at least\
    \ to the current version of \u2018you\u2019 that is speaking to god. The idea\
    \ rests on the implication of that the self is the sum of all currently accessible\
    \ memories (I know it sounds a bit dualist, I\u2019m ignoring the material properties\
    \ for now, so I suppose I\u2019m more describing the sense of \u2018self\u2019\
    \ rather than \u2018self\u2019 as a whole). If I choose the second option a person\
    \ with my name, face, physical features and most of my history will still exist,\
    \ but it is impossible for the \u2018self\u2019 to consciously move from the current\
    \ state to a state where 24 hours has been \u2018erased\u2019, as it I would involve\
    \ a complete break in consciousness.\n\nTo use an example, in the Matrix there\
    \ is a scene where Cypher is in a caf\xE9 with an Agent betraying Neo and the\
    \ others in order to be put back into the matrix with a much better life. He says\
    \ that he wants to be \u201Csomeone important, like an actor\u201D, and that he\
    \ doesn\u2019t want to remember anything about what he\u2019s learned of the true\
    \ nature of the world. What\u2019s the point in him doing this? \u2018He\u2019\
    , as in the \u2018he\u2019 sitting in the caf\xE9, will not know that he has been\
    \ given a second chance in the matrix - it will be a new version with the mind\
    \ wiped clean. One state of consciousness is stopped, another is commenced from\
    \ fresh. They are two separate lives that can never interact and share only superficial\
    \ commonality.\n\nA similar example can be taken from the idea of reincarnation.\
    \ It\u2019s reasonable to say that people only extremely rarely \u201Cremember\u201D\
    \ a previous life, however the Buddhist concept of reincarnation says that it\
    \ is preferable to be reincarnated as a better or \u2018higher\u2019 form of life\
    \ than a lower, i.e. it is better to be reborn as an emperor than as a sewer rat.\
    \ Why? The rat doesn\u2019t remember ever being a human, otherwise it would logically\
    \ attempt to communicate with humans and would find it very difficult and unpleasant\
    \ to live it\u2019s new life. So what possible reason would I have for caring\
    \ what form I am reincarnated as? It will have no consequence to the \u2018me\u2019\
    \ that is addressing the concept now.\n\nUnless I\u2019m wrong the only conclusion\
    \ that can be drawn is that any removal of a \u2018section\u2019 of consciousness,\
    \ in a sense, no different to death - at least to the \u2018self\u2019 at the\
    \ moment before consciousness is broken (which arguably is the only reality we\
    \ are empirically able to experience). One argument is that we go to sleep every\
    \ night and don\u2019t remember the previous 8 hours, however in this case there\
    \ is still a steady chain of consciousness from falling asleep to waking up. The\
    \ mind has not forgotten the last 8 hours, just not recorded it, therefore it\
    \ is the same as the difference between pausing and resuming a tape to removing\
    \ a section from it and patching it back up.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the\
    \ first person to ask this question, does anyone know of anything written on the\
    \ subject specifically? \n\nEDIT \u2013 Semantically I\u2019m using the word \u201C\
    consciousness\u201D to describe a state in which we are able to record and keep\
    \ memories and relate them to all previously stored memories.\n\n2nd EDIT - As\
    \ a few people have raised this point, I don't personally believe in god or an\
    \ immortal soul. My question really isn't about anything religious or moral, I\
    \ just used this as a familiar example.\n\n"

  selftext: "I've been amazed to read that the [unexpected hanging paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox)\
    \ is stated as unresolved. I'm sure a 20 minute thinking session by myself can't\
    \ be the definitive answer to something far smarter people have looked at, but\
    \ I see no flaw in my thinking. Did I really solve this?\n\nThe 'surprise' means\
    \ not knowing when you'll be hanged. There are several possible meanings of 'surprise'\
    \ or 'not knowing', and beforehand we don't know to which one the judge is referring.\
    \ So, refer to these three possible definitions:\n\n* **1. surprise means that\
    \ you are given a subset of more than one days that you may be hanged.** (in this\
    \ case five)\n*Your accumulated knowledge of the subset being shrunk due to days\
    \ passed, is not taken into account. This seems a lame definition for the judge\
    \ to use, as that means it's only a surprise at the moment of sentencing, but\
    \ not necessarily on the day of the execution itself. The paradox does not explicity\
    \ prohibit this definition, but it stretches 'surprise' to a very thin meaning.*\n\
    \n* **2. surprise means you are given an initial subset of more than one days\
    \ AND for a day to qualify into this subset, on the day itself the subset of remaining\
    \ days must be > 1** This will leave you with four qualifying days: monday through\
    \ thursday.\n*This still seems a narrow definition of surprise, but it means that\
    \ the surprise is that there are five possible days and on thursday morning the\
    \ hanging is still a surprise, because there subset of remaining days is more\
    \ than one. In other words, the judge is not counting on your use of deductive\
    \ reasoning on possible future situations in his meaning of the word surprise,\
    \ which is kind of reasonable.*\n\n* **3. surprise means you are given an initial\
    \ subset of more than one days AND for a day to qualify into this subset, on the\
    \ day itself the subset of remaining days that pass deductive analysis of future\
    \ situations must be > 1** This will leave you with no qualifying days: all days\
    \ can be discounted through this reasoning.\n\n*Now here's the crux: this disqualifies\
    \ this definition. Often people might think that this definition holds, because\
    \ the judge, even if he knew you would think all this through, this thinking would\
    \ not yield usable information as an outcome. That's true, because all days are\
    \ discounted. But it's also true that IF the judge adheres to this definition,\
    \ his statement is internally contradictory. It's the same as saying: \"you'll\
    \ be sentenced on a weekday, but not on monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday or\
    \ friday\" So, for that reason we HAVE to discard this definition.*\n\nIt is therefore\
    \ reasonable to assume the judge is using either definition 1 (unlikely) or 2\
    \ (likely) and since we have no way of knowing which of the two is correct, the\
    \ subset of qualifying days is (mo, tue, wed, thu, fri) + (mo, tue, wed, thu)\
    \ = (mo, tue, wed, thu, fri). \n\nYou could make a linguistic argument that definition\
    \ 1 does not sufficiently cover the meaning of surprise or phrase the paradox\
    \ so that *on the day of hanging* it is not known to the subject that he will\
    \ be killed. That seems reasonable. In that case, only definition 2 applies, which\
    \ I feel is the case here.\n\nSo the answer is: monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday\
    \ all qualify as 'surprise' days.\n\nTLDR: it all depends on your definition of\
    \ surprise, but since the judge **can't** mean that you don't know it if you think\
    \ it all through,  he must mean that it's a surprise if there are more than one\
    \ day left. Answer is monday through thursday."

    I''m talking about children around the age of 5 or so, when they start being exposed
    to death and possibly life, and you have to start explaining yourself with a more
    mature tone.



    Anyway, if you do think it should be taught, how far do you go with it? Do you
    go all the way to explaining that you are the universe? Do you expand to different
    types of philosophy? It beg another question, how far would you push science in
    order to explain philosophy?


    However, if you''re not for teaching them at a young age, then why not? Do you
    feel as though it could be damaging to a child''s development? How? In what ways
    is science and philosophy pointless to teach?

  selftext: 'I''m [Andrew Sepielli](http://andrewsepielli.weebly.com), and I''m an
    assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto.


    Of course, you can ask me anything, but if you''re wondering what it''d be most
    profitable to ask me about, or what I''d be most interested in being asked, here''s
    a bit about my research:


    Right now, I work mainly in metaethics; more specifically, I''m writing a book
    about nihilism and normlessness, and how we might overcome these conditions through
    philosophy. It''s "therapeutic metaethics", you might say -- although I hasten
    to add that it doesn''t have much to do with Wittgenstein.


    Right now, I envision the book as having five parts:

    1) An introduction

    2) A section in which I (a) say what normlessness and nihilism are, and (b) try
    to explain how they arise and sustain themselves. I take normlessness to be a
    social-behavioral phenomenon and nihilism to be an affective-motivational one.
    Some people think that the meta-ethical theories we adopt have little influence
    on our behaviour or our feelings. I''ll try to suggest that their influence is
    greater, and that some meta-ethical theories -- namely, error theory and subjectivism/relativism
    -- may play a substantial role in giving rise to nihilism and normlessness, and
    in sustaining them.

    3) A section in which I try to get people to give up error theory and subjectivism
    -- although not via the standard arguments against these views -- and instead
    accept what I call the "pragmatist interpretation": an alternative explanation
    of the primitive, pre-theoretical differences between ethics and ordinary factual
    inquiry/debate that is, I suspect, less congenial to nihilism and normlessness
    than error theory and subjectivism are.

    4) A section in which I attempt to talk readers out of normlessness and nihilism,
    or at least talk people *into* *other* ways of overcoming normlessness and nihilism,
    once they have accepted the the "pragmatist interpretation" from the previous
    chapter.

    5) A final chapter in which I explain how what I''ve tried to do differs from
    what other writers have tried to do -- e.g. other analytic meta-ethicists, Nietzsche,
    Rorty, the French existentialists, etc. This is part lit-review, part an attempt
    to warn readers against assimilating what I''ve argued to what''s already been
    argued by these more famous writers, especially those whose work is in the spirit
    of mine, but who are importantly wrong on crucial points.


    Anyhow, that''s a brief summary of what I''m working on now, but since this is
    an AMA, please AMA!



    EDIT (2:35 PM): **I must rush off to do something else, but I will return to offer
    more replies later today!**


    EDIT (5:22 PM): **Okay, I''m back. Forgive me if it takes a while to address all
    the questions.**

    ME ABOUT THIS STUFF. I HOPE TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING AS PART OF THIS COMMUNITY!**'

    \ in the *Journal of Applied Philosophy*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/24355020?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),\
    \ argues against those who claim that it cannot be right to say that it is ever\
    \ *worse* for an existing person to exist than for the person never to have existed\
    \ at all.  Roberts is interested in this question because she is a person-based\
    \ consequentialist, not an aggregative consequentialist; rather than being concerned\
    \ with aggregate wellbeing, she \"considers the permissibility of a given choice\
    \ to depend critically on whether that choice wrongs some person or another\"\
    \ (Roberts 160). Her motivations for writing this paper lie elsewhere than where\
    \ I will focus, but I want to critically examine Roberts' justifications for believing\
    \ that it can be better for someone never to have existed at all. Specifically,\
    \ my concern is that it relies upon the idea that non-existing persons have a\
    \ wellbeing value that we can compare with the wellbeing values of existing persons,\

    \ be true of any child she conceives *next* month, since Ms. Needflaw's condition\
    \ is self-limiting and will have run its course by then. The disease is serious\
    \ and will *anguish* Nora's life; her life will be unambiguously not worth living,\
    \ it will possess \"little or none of that which gives value to life\" and Nora\
    \ will suffer \"every physical and emotional form of unremitting pain\" (Roberts\
    \ 166\u20137). There are no other important considerations: it doesn't matter\
    \ to Ms. Needflaw or to anyone else, in any morally significant way, whether Ms.\
    \ Needflaw conceives a child this month or next month, or if she produces a child\
    \ afflicted with the condition or a distinct child who is not. She goes ahead\
    \ and births Nora.\n\nWith this case in mind, Roberts defends a principle she\
    \ calls the *betterness of never existing at all for Nora*:\n\n* BNB. Any alternative\
    \ at which Nora never exists at all would have been better for Nora than Nora's\
    \ anguished existence in fact is.\n\nShe justifies this with the following two\
    \ arguments:\n\n* P1. At any alternative at which Nora never exists at all, the\
    \ level of wellbeing that Nora has at that alternative is zero.\n\n* P2. The level\
    \ of wellbeing that Nora in fact has is negative.\n\nP2 is obvious from the thought\
    \ experiment, because Nora's life is anguished as Roberts describes. But let's\
    \ examine how Roberts defends P1:\n\n> P1 and P2 are true in virtue of the fact\
    \ that at the alternatives specified Nora has certain properties and lacks others.\
    \ More particularly, P1 is true in virtue of the fact that, first, Nora does not\
    \ have any properties at all at any alternative at which she does not exist and,\
    \ second, that, where Nora has no properties at all, all the properties that she\
    \ does have \u2014 that empty set \u2014 add up to a zero level of wellbeing [29].\
    \ (Roberts 169)\n\n**The Wellbeing of the Non-Existing**\n\nThere are two accounts\
    \ of wellbeing for the non-existing that I am familiar with. Some say the non-existing\
    \ have a wellbeing of zero; call this the Zero Value View. On the other view,\
    \ the non-existing do not have a wellbeing at all, which means that it is not\
    \ zero, but simply does not exist and is not comparable to the wellbeing values\
    \ of the existing. Let's call it the No Value View.\n\nIn \"The Benefits of Coming\
    \ Into Existence,\" [published in *Philosophical Studies*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40208914),\
    \ Krister Bykvist argues that we are not better off or worse off having been born\
    \ than we would have been if we were not created. He says this is true because\
    \ of the No Value View, for nothing has value for us if we do not exist. First,\
    \ he explains an argument originally presented by John Broome, that \"having no\
    \ value is not the same thing as having zero value \u2026 logic has no temperature,\
    \ but that does not mean that it has zero temperature and thus is colder than\
    \ the ocean\" (Bykvist 343).\n\nThen, he examines what Nils Holtug's attempt to\
    \ salvage the Zero Value view \u2014 an attempt similar to Roberts', that argues\
    \ that \"even if the presence of certain properties is crucial for zero temperature,\
    \ it is the absence of certain properties that is crucial for zero value\" \u2014\
    \ Bykvist says that, *either* **(a)** one does not exist and therefore cannot\
    \ stand in a relation like 'is neutral for,' *or* **(b)** 'is neutral for' does\
    \ not express a relation but \"only expresses ... the absence of the instantiations\
    \ of the relations of being good for and being bad for,\" which he finds logically\
    \ objectionable for a host of reasons that I will not recapitulate here (Bykvist\
    \ 343\u20134).\n\nThe (b) objection does not apply to Roberts, for whom 'is neutral\
    \ for' seems to express not that there are no relations like 'good for' or 'bad\
    \ for' a person, but only that Nora has no properties at all, including any that\
    \ bear on one\u2019s wellbeing. So, her wellbeing sums to zero. This matches Roberts'\
    \ understanding of wellbeing: \"having a specific level of wellbeing \u2014 positive,\
    \ negative, or zero \u2014 is a matter of having certain properties and lacking\
    \ others\" (Roberts 168). In this way, Roberts' argument seems similar to Holtug's:\
    \ the absence of certain properties is crucial for zero value.\n\nSo let's turn\
    \ to (a), the **attribution argument**, according to which there is never anyone\
    \ for nonexistence to be better for. Take Roberts' cases:\n\n* **Sadie** has more\
    \ money in the bank at possible world A than she does at possible world B, where\
    \ she does not exist. It isn't true that Sadie has more money in the world at\
    \ B than at A.\n\n* **Martha** endures more prosecutions at possible world A than\
    \ she does at possible world B, where she does not exist. It isn't true that Martha\
    \ endures more prosecutions at B than at A.\n\n* **Dick** exists more at possible\
    \ world A than he does at possible world B, where he does not exist. He still\
    \ has existence at A and not at B if he exists in A and not at B.\n\nThese are\
    \ meant to suggest that cross-world comparisons of single individuals are not\
    \ beholden to a *dual possession requirement*, that is, \"there are plenty of\
    \ comparative, cross-world properties that need not be possessed by the individual\
    \ who has them at both of the two worlds that are being compared\" (Roberts 176).\
    \ But the only reason for this is that while the person doesn't need to exist,\
    \ the *amounts* (of money in the  bank, of prosecutions endured, of ...existence?)\
    \ being compared do.\n\nThis would refute the (a) objection; we aren't comparing\
    \ properties of an existing person with the properties of a non-existing person,\
    \ rather, we are comparing the amounts of well-being that the possession or absence\
    \ of such properties amount to for the person who would (or would not) have them.\n\
    \n**The Value of Existence**\n\nBykvist's arguments are avoided, but Broome's\
    \ is not. A non-existent person's wellbeing could be like logic's temperature\
    \ in the sense that neither has a value, for the concepts are incompatible. Temperature\
    \ does not bear on logic; wellbeing does not bare on the non-existent.\n\nRoberts\
    \ does not address this argument, and I have not seen anyone attempt to do so.\
    \ Nobody seems able to present an account for why wellbeing is neutral in the\
    \ sense of having zero value rather than no value at all. So we should reject\
    \ Roberts' account of BNB, and not say that never existing at all would have been\
    \ better for Nora. (This does not keep us from saying that Ms. Needflaw should\
    \ not have created Nora and rather should have waited a month to conceive a child.\
    \ This also does not mean that we can't say that it would be better for Nora to\
    \ *no longer* exist, or to die, than for her to continue living in an anguished\
    \ state.)\n\nLet me know what you think of this argument, let me know if you think\
    \ you can defend the Zero Value View, etc. etc. Hope this was an enjoyable read!"

  selftext: "**The unawareness of the machine and how is it different from the human\
    \ brain**\n\n\nOn the beginning people tried to understand the mind by studying\
    \ what is it made of. Descartes announced his Substance Dualism (mind is immaterial\
    \ substance and body is material substance). Later, the Identity Theory arisen\
    \ (both mind and body are material substances). And finally, the functionalism\
    \ theory got power, in which you study the mind not based on what is it made of,\
    \ but based on its function \u2013 what does it do. \n\nTrying to understand how\
    \ our mind works at the same time that computers were being invented made some\
    \ philosophers come to a big hypothesis: our mind works just like the computers.\
    \ According to those philosophers, our mind was just a good processing part of\
    \ our body that would get inputs and would bring out outputs. This hypothesis\
    \ was backed up by the Turing Test that was a test proposed to define if a machine\
    \ can think or not. And when it passes the Turing test, the processing power of\
    \ a machine and a human brain wouldn\u2019t be so distinct.\n\nHowever, I go against\
    \ the opinion of those philosophers. First of all, I don\u2019t think the Turing\
    \ Test is a good way of measuring whether a machine can think or not for 3 reasons:\
    \ it\u2019s too anthropocentric (suppose an alien that knew English came to Earth,\
    \ he wouldn\u2019t be able to pass the Turing Test because of his lack of human\
    \ knowledge); it\u2019s language based (suppose an alien who knows everything\
    \ about the human history but doesn\u2019t know English comes to Earth, he wouldn\u2019\
    t be able to pass the Turing Test because of his lack of knowledge on human language);\
    \ and, most important, it doesn\u2019t take in consideration the inside way of\
    \ getting to a decision.\n\nWhat do I mean by it doesn\u2019t take in consideration\
    \ the inside way of getting to a decision? Let\u2019s think about the 2 ways you\
    \ can think about things: a semantic way and a syntactic way. The syntactic way\
    \ is the one that you just think about the size, format, calculation and direction\
    \ of things. While the semantic way is the way in which you just think about the\
    \ reason for things and the relationships of knowledge. Knowing those 2 concepts,\
    \ I think that the human brain and the computer are 2 different things because\
    \ of the fact that the computer can only think in a syntactic way, while the human\
    \ brain can think in a syntactic and semantic way. To back up my hypothesis there\
    \ is the John Searle's 'Chinese Room' Thought Experiment.\n\nThe Chinese Room\
    \ Thought Experiment is as following: suppose you are alone in a room with just\
    \ 2 things to do. There is box I (input) that from time to time you receive a\
    \ paper with a random symbol and there is box O (output) that from time to time\
    \ you have to put inside the box O a piece of paper with a correct symbol. The\
    \ correct symbol you are going to put inside the box O totally depends on what\
    \ is received in the box I. Just behind you, there are an insanely big amount\
    \ of books, all in which have the solely purpose to translate the symbol you receive\
    \ in the box I to a correct symbol you have to put in the box O. And even though\
    \ you don\u2019t know what you are doing, you keep doing this task and putting\
    \ the correct symbols on the box O according to the symbols you receive in box\
    \ I.\n\nHowever, what you don\u2019t know is that you are actually having a conversation\
    \ with a Chinese who is in the other side of the room through text messages (or\
    \ paper messages). For the Chinese, the external one, you seem like you really\
    \ know Chinese, but in fact you don\u2019t even know the existence of the Chinese\
    \ in the other room. The internal one, you, is totally blind to what is happening\
    \ and the meaning of things.\n\nTherefore, I believe this thought experiment really\
    \ represents what machines are doing, and how unaware and different they are to\
    \ the world compared to the human brain. \n"

  selftext: 'As a thought experiment, I wondered if a hypothetical mechanical supercomputer
    made of pulleys and levers could achieve self-awareness. It doesn''t matter how
    such a thing would be constructed, it''s hypothetical, but I imagine it being
    the size of an entire planet. There *are* wires, but these wires only carry electricity
    to power the motors that move the levers and such. All the "calculating" is done
    mechanically. I know there are/were primitive mechanical computers that just did
    simple math. Also, I''m aware that a computer achieving consciousness is just
    an idea to begin with, but we generally accept the possibility because it seems
    plausible. I''ve even seen a video where a logical circuit was made with dominos,
    and it could do simple math.


    The most important question isn''t "could this mechanical computer become self-aware",
    it''s "WHERE would the awareness come from?"


    The self-awareness couldn''t come from the wires or motors or power source because
    they only get their commands from the pulleys and levers. Just like a light switch
    sort of tells a light to come on, but neither the wires nor the switch itself
    made that decision, the person flipping the switch is the one with the consciousness.


    But in this case the "person" flipping the switch is just levers and pulleys being
    actuated by other motors, powered by wires connected to more levers and pulleys.
    There are if/and gates and all that just like a computer but they cannot talk
    to each other.


    Surely the self-awareness wouldn''t lie in any one single pulley or lever, and
    the computer as a whole couldn''t be considered an organism because the only thing
    linking the pulleys and levers together (the wires and motors) don''t carry information.


    There are parallels to this thought experiment and the fact that our own bodies
    are made up of millions of cells all acting independently, but there is clearly
    a central self-awareness somewhere, right?'

    connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language."
    That covers just about everything, and many different philosophers have approached
    these problems in radically different ways. Please reduce the use of comments
    such as "not philosophy" or "doesn''t belong here", and instead consider that
    your self-limited concept of philosophy may be the problem. If nothing else, just
    use the downvote button alone to signal your disdain for the post and save yourself
    the time you''re wasting by adding a comment with the same meaning as the downvote.


    * This isn''t school. Any post is a stimulus and philosophical discussion about
    it can occur without being initiated by submitter-conditional framing or interrogatives.
    If you have an interesting response to the stimulus, share it; don''t criticize
    the submitter for failing to obscure the forest for the trees. For example, I
    shouldn''t need to say here "What do you think are the problems of r/philosophy?"
    for you to comment on what you think are the problems of r/philosophy, if you
    want to do it, just do it; if I were to say here "What do you think are the problems
    of r/philosophy?" then maybe I''ve somehow prevented you from making some other
    type of comment you may have wanted to make and would have been interesting to
    the discussion but now you won''t make it because it doesn''t match the framing
    interrogative.'

  selftext: "I used to take Comparative Religion, and found a bond with the prof through\
    \ our shared respect for Taoism. It is a philosophy - and a poignant one at that\
    \ - which stands it's ground in the realm of religious teachings that strive to\
    \ indoctrinate you into an extroverted state of mind. It speaks of 'The Way',\
    \ which sounds much like the usual religious rhetoric, but contrary to what so\
    \ many Western belief-holders have interpreted it as, the true nature of the 'Way'\
    \ is in no way supernatural. This is poetry, aimed only at one thing: helping\
    \ you to understand the mental space you need to be in to find balance within\
    \ yourself, and the minutes of your life. This entire book helped shape my perspective\
    \ on myself and society, and I figured I'd share my favourite verse.\n\n*ahem*\n\
    \n\nWhen life begins, we are tender and weak.\n \nWhen life ends, we are stiff\
    \ and rigid.\n\nAll things, including the grass and the trees,\n\nAre soft and\
    \ pliable in life, dry and brittle in death.\n\nSo the soft and supple are the\
    \ companions of life,\n\nWhilst the stiff and unyielding are the companions of\
    \ death.\n\nAn army that cannot yield will be defeated.\n\nA tree that cannot\
    \ bend will crack in the wind.\n\nThus, by nature's own decree,\n\nThe hard and\
    \ strong are defeated,\n\nWhilst the soft and gentle are triumphant.\n\n\n**EDIT:**\
    \ So, after waking up this morning and re-reading what I wrote in the preface\
    \ to the verse, I understand where I went wrong. Didn't mean to say any of that\
    \ matter-of-factly, its just IMHO. I first read this text in a really bad time\
    \ in my life, and it kind of embedded itself into the fashion of reflecting upon\
    \ society and the human condition (I'm sure 2 years of psychology had nothing\
    \ to do with that...).\n\nReally, I could have just posted the verse. I love the\
    \ commentary & discussion, but I always feel like a fool when my words so effectively\
    \ misinterpret my intentions. \n\nPeace&Blessings. "

  selftext: "Hi there,\n\nI am wondering if I can get you guys' thoughts and opinions\
    \ on creating some sort of educational curriculum revolving around teaching philosophy,\
    \ psychology and sociology for adults within the disadvantaged demographics within\
    \ the community?\nThroughout much of my professional (nonprofits/social services/classroom)\
    \ and academic (psychology and philosophy) experiences, I have long sought after\
    \ some form of integration between the depths of critical inquiry/analysis within\
    \ the academia and conventional concerns of everyday life within the community.\
    \ Therefore, I am hoping to work on a project where the attitude of critical discourse\
    \ and skepticism can be brought directly into the community (especially from philosophy),\
    \ particularly for those who are socially and economically disadvantaged. \n\n\
    I am coming from the notion that the learning of philosophy represents a medium\
    \ that can facilitate the development of critical consciousness. Much of the discussion\
    \ on the development of critical consciousness revolves around being more informed\
    \ about the structural and political processes that intersect with one's social\
    \ position; and philosophy would be an excellent vehicle for such critical examinations.\
    \ However, I am starting to think that perhaps the development of critical consciousness\
    \ should also be inclusive of a consciousness of one's internal psychological\
    \ and even existential conditions; therefore, how these internal conditions then\
    \ interact with structural forces. \n\nPeople may straightforwardly learn about\
    \ their current societal affairs and conditions and proceed to make daily decisions\
    \ based on their knowledge upon the worldly and socially based events. Yet the\
    \ underlying personal inclinations toward certain emphases of attitudes and perspectives\
    \ that are informed by their unique psychological and existential processes may\
    \ remain largely un-examined; both conceptually and experientially. And it is\
    \ very much these processes that inform our daily mundane decisions that when\
    \ amassed on a collective and cumulative levels, result in societal and historical\
    \ zeitgeists. We may explicitly and passionately assert our opinions and behaviours\
    \ as to rally against the injustice towards the disadvantaged, yet can't help\
    \ but to habitually derive existential comforts from the objective absolutes of\
    \ the modern consumerist identity.\n\nUltimately, my current directions for the\
    \ project rest in providing an educational curriculum to the disadvantaged revolving\
    \ around the basic topics of philosophy, psychology and sociology as a way to\
    \ hopefully allow learners to gain more insights in how they work, how society\
    \ works, and how these two elements work together. In such cases, the conditions\
    \ of society would rest upon the simple day-to-day activities of conscious individuals,\
    \ as opposed to some form of intense radicalism that is based on last-minute emotional\
    \ projections of anger, frustration and even indifference.\n\nI am not sure how\
    \ this is going to pan out, all I know is that I think it is important for these\
    \ discussions to hold place in the community and it needs to be equipped with\
    \ a level of depth and critical inquiry not only for structural issues, but also\
    \ for our personal ones. \n\nI am wondering what you guys think of integrating\
    \ philosophy, psychology and sociology into the community that is readily accessible\
    \ for adults? Is this a project you think worth working on within the community?\
    \ And do you know of any similar projects within community?\n\nThanks so much!"

  selftext: 'The thread about how to study philosophy as an amateur (and also the
    fact that I enjoyed a lot the past reading groups and the Weekly Discussions)
    encouraged me to create a reading group about one of the most important, if not
    the most important book in the history of philosophy: Plato''s Republic. I believe
    this has the potential to benefit not only those who never touched the book before,
    but also those who already have experience with it.


    I did my masters about this book and also gave courses on it as a professor. I
    feel confident that I can organize and lead a reading group about the *Republic*
    if there''s people willing to participate. So, what do you say?


    EDIT: In the next days (most likely on the weekend), I will create another thread
    here on this subreddit (unless the mods decide differently) to officially open
    the Reading Group. On that post, I''m going to add a provisional schedule, a comment
    on translations, recommended readings and a small commentary on what the word
    *politeia* means. It''ll also be a place to gather suggestions about should we
    proceed as a reading group.'

  selftext: 'Lately i''ve been thinking about human teleportation and if anyone should
    ever want to do it. This inevitably got me thinking about consciousness and i''d
    like to know what other people think about this. Let''s start with some thought
    experiments (i''ll give my answers after each one):


    **If you were to step into a machine (teleporter) which destroys your body and
    recreates it (exactly the same) in a separate location, would you be conscious
    of the new copy or will you have died along with your original body?** Personally,
    I think you would only be conscious of the original body seeing as there is no
    continuity with the new body. I don''t see a way in which you can transfer consciousness
    from one brain to another through space. So when you step into the machine, you
    are essentially allowing yourself to be killed just so that a copy of you can
    live on in another location.


    **In another experiment, you step into a machine which puts you to sleep and swaps
    your atoms out with new ones (the same elements). It swaps them out one by one
    over a period of time, waking you up every now and then until your whole body
    is made up of new atoms. Will you have ''died'' at one point or will you still
    be conscious of the body that wakes up each time? What happens if the machine
    swaps them all out at the exact same time?** I find this one slightly harder to
    wrap my head around. On the one hand, I still believe that continuity is key,
    and so slowly changing your atoms will make sure that it is still you experiencing
    the body. I get this idea from what happens to us throughout our whole lives.
    Our cells are constantly being replaced by newer ones when the old ones are not
    fit to work anymore and yet we are still conscious of ourselves. However, I have
    heard that some of our neurons never get replaced. I''m not sure what this suggests
    but it could mean that replacing the neurons with new ones would stop the continuity
    and therefore stop you from being conscious of the body. In regards to swapping
    all the atoms out at once, I think that would just kill you instantly after all
    the original atoms have been removed.


    **Your body is frozen and then split in half, vertically, from head to hip. Each
    half is made complete with a copy of the other half and then both bodies are unfrozen.
    Which body are you conscious of, if any?** A part of me wants to say that your
    consciousness stays dead after you are split in half and that two new copies of
    you have been created. But that would suggest that you cannot stay conscious of
    your own body after you have ''died'' (stopped all metabolism) even if you are
    resurrected.


    ~~(Forgive me if this is in the wrong subreddit but it''s the best place I can
    think of at the moment).~~


    Edit: I just want to make clear something that others have misunderstood about
    what i''m saying here. I''m not trying to advocate the idea that any original
    copy of someone is more ''real'' or conscious than the new copy. I don''t think
    that the new copies will be zombies or anything like that. What I think is that
    your present-self, right now (your consciousness in this moment), cannot be transferred
    across space to an identical copy of yourself. If I created an identical copy
    of you right now, you would not ever experience two bodies at the same time in
    a sort of split-screen fashion (making even more copies shows how absurd the idea
    that you can experience multiple bodies of yourself seems). The identical copy
    of yourself would be a separate entity, he would only know how you feel or what
    you think by intuition, not because he also experiences your reality.


    A test for this idea could be this:

    **You step into a machine; it has a 50% chance of copying your body exactly and
    recreating it in another room across the world. Your task is to guess if there
    is a clone in the other room or not. The test is repeated multiple times** If
    you can experience two identical bodies at once, you should be able to guess it
    right 100% of the time. If you can only ever experience your own body, you should
    only have a 50% chance of guessing it right due to there being two possible answers.'

  selftext: 'I''m a physicist, and pretty much every time that people here talk about
    physics, all the completely wrong answers get upvoted, and the right answers get
    downvoted.


    [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/18p183/could_the_world_at_the_scale_we_understand_it_be/c8guesp)
    is such an example.  Someone declares that energy cannot be defined in physics,
    and gets upvoted.


    In physics, we don''t use words that we don''t fully and completely define (to
    within an accuracy needed for whatever is being discussed).  *Even if we don''t
    fully understand them*.  It doesn''t mean that everyone agrees on which definition
    to use, or that there is only one definition, but that if there is any ambiguity,
    the physicist simply states which definition they are using.


    Please, don''t trust any physics knowledge that you gain here.  Ask in a science
    subreddit if you aren''t sure.


    Edit: Removed my comment about physics being unlike philosophy.'

  selftext: 'After working several years in the field of applied physics, returned
    back to my old passion in the foundations and philosophical implications of quantum
    mechanics, and which I feel to share with others. I built a non mathematical but
    scientifically sound introduction for all enthusiastic learners, especially those
    with philosophically inclined minds, who want to discover the weirdness of the
    quantum world. It is a non-academic course and yet the most rigorous possible
    introduction devoid of the frequent misunderstandings and the typical "quantumhypes"
    of the "popular science" magazines. If you don''t have a degree in physics, work
    in a different field (e.g. philosophy), but are curious to discover the whys and
    how of the quantum world, then this course is for you. A future extended version
    will address (still in a comprehensible format) the recent experiments that tested
    quantum mechanics, and which even most physicist don''t know about.


    Since **I quit my job** ([for reasons you can read here](http://freeprogressuniversity.org/about-this-blog/))
    in order to dedicate myself to a **full time not paid teaching**, your help is
    appreciated (for a $5, $10, 19$ donation, use code: 5$phi, 10$phi, or take it
    at full price respectively **[here](https://www.udemy.com/quantum-physics/)**),
    but you can watch it also for free (use code: freephi ).


    So, if you want to be up to date with a fascinating topic **[check out and take
    the course!](https://www.udemy.com/quantum-physics/)** Note that you can use the
    "free preview" feature or watch the lectures made free!


    PS: I know my fluency in English needs an urgent refinement. I will work on it.
    But this is only the first step towards a larger and improved project which envisages
    the creation of a state of the art quantum primer.


    PPS: If you like the course please rate it and write a short review (upper right
    side on the course webpage), and/or suggest it on your social network, etc.


    **Please note**: It does NOT require a facebook login, you can sign in also with
    a standard (name, email, psw) login.


    **Thanks for the appreciations, suggestions and help!**

    is limited to an introductory college course on ethics.


    My argument is that it is theoretically impossible to act immorally under the
    Kantian principle of humanity (that one must always treat a human being (yourself
    included) as an end, and never as a mere means).


    Premises:


    1) In order to have the capacity to act immorally one must be part of the "Moral
    Community"


    2) In order to be a part of the "Moral Community" one must be rational and autonomous.


    3) Moral/Immoral acts are defined by categorical imperatives


    4) Those who ignore or disobey categorical imperatives are acting contrary to
    reason (i.e., irrationally)


    5) If one acts contrary to reason they can''t be part of the moral community


    Conclusion:

    It is impossible for someone to act immorally, because anyone who acts immorally
    isn''t part of the moral community and thus lacks the capacity.'

    \ of math. So I somehow got into the PhD program at Ohio State and did my PhD\
    \ with Stewart Shapiro, Neil Tennant, and George Schumm. I also did all the coursework\
    \ for a Masters in mathematics, but never wrote the thesis. \n\nAfter that I worked\
    \ as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Arche Centre at the University of St\
    \ Andrews, which at the time was the most exciting place in the world to be if\
    \ you wanted to learn about logic and the philosophy of math. I then taught for\
    \ three years at Villanova University, which is primarily a continental philosophy\
    \ program, which was interesting and useful in a completely different way. Finally,\
    \ I landed at the University of Minnesota, where I am now CLA Scholar of the College,\
    \ Professor, and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Philosophy\
    \ and Resident Fellow, Member of the Governing Board, and Member of the Executive\
    \ Committee at the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science (MCPS).\n\nMy primary\
    \ area of interest was and continues to be the philosophy of mathematics and logic.\
    \ Most of my work in these areas centers in one way or another on paradoxes. \n\
    \nThus, I have written a good bit on the Liar Paradox, and am developing an account\
    \ of truth that addresses this puzzle (and its harder version \u2013 the Revenge\
    \ Problem) called the Embracing Revenge account. Nicholas Tourville \u2013 just\
    \ finishing up his PhD at Rutgers \u2013 has collaborated with me on my most recent\
    \ work on this topic. In addition, I wrote a book a few years ago about the Yablo\
    \ Paradox \u2013 a semantic paradox that, unlike the Liar, arguably involves no\
    \ circularity. But my work on logic sometimes doesn\u2019t involve paradoxes \u2013\
    \ for example, I\u2019ve written a good bit on logical pluralism, and I\u2019\
    ve also written on the pseudo-logical-connective Tonk and on intuitionistic logic.\n\
    My work in the philosophy of mathematics is mostly centered on (1) historical\
    \ work on Gottlob Frege\u2019s late 19th Century logicist project to reduce all\
    \ of mathematics (except geometry) to logic, and (2) Neo-logicism, a contemporary\
    \ variant of Frege\u2019s project that involves reducing all of logic to a special\
    \ kind of implicit definition known as an *abstraction principle*. The Russell\
    \ paradox looms large in this work \u2013 again, more paradox-mongering! \u2013\
    \ since one of the challenges of the neo-logicist project is to determine which\
    \ abstraction principles are \u2018okay\u2019 and which are prone to paradoxes\
    \ like the Russell paradox and other, related problems.\n\nMore recently, however,\
    \ I have begun working seriously in the philosophy of popular art. Much, but not\
    \ all, of this work focuses on comics. My main focus in this work is sorting out\
    \ the formal features of comics that differentiate them from other art works,\
    \ and the norms of storytelling at work in comics that might differentiate them\
    \ from other artworks in other ways. Thus, I pay a lot of attention to meta-comics\
    \ \u2013 that is, comics that break these formal rules or storytelling norms in\
    \ various ways \u2013 and as a result I get to write about a wide range of really\
    \ strange comics like the *Sensational She-Hulk*, *Peanuts*, and lots of Grant\
    \ Morrison\u2019s work. But I\u2019ve also written about other issues in popular\
    \ art, including paradoxes generated by Wonder Woman\u2019s golden lasso (joint\
    \ work with Nathan Kellen), designer toys, serial fiction, and LEGO minifigures.\
    \ In addition to many articles, I\u2019ve co-edited two volumes of academic work\
    \ on comics and one volume (forthcoming) on the philosophy of LEGO.\n\nBy the\
    \ way, if you don\u2019t think of *Peanuts* as dark and weird, you\u2019re only\
    \ reading the carefully curated, reprints of the lighthearted material produced\
    \ by Schulz\u2019s estate after his death. Go pick up a couple of the complete\
    \ archive volumes from the 1950s or 1960s and you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019\
    m talking about.\nAnd speaking of LEGO, when I am not writing about logic, math,\
    \ or comics, I am an adult fan of LEGO (AFOL). I am a former LEGO Ambassador,\
    \ and I am on the coordinator committee for the yearly Brickworld LEGO convention\
    \ in Schaumburg, Illinois \u2013 the biggest adult LEGO fan convention in North\
    \ America. My wife and I own roughly 3.5 million LEGO elements, and we build everything\
    \ from zombie pirate islands to complicated mosaics to swooshable spaceships.\
    \ We\u2019re currently collaborating with members of our LEGO club on a huge model\
    \ of all of Westeros for next June\u2019s Brickworld.\n\n**Some of My Work and\

  selftext: "I want to be a psychiatrist so this problem really plagues me. There\
    \ seems to be a prevailing attitude that if a mental illness makes you do something\
    \ and that it is not really \"you\" that is acting. This seems to be the basis\
    \ for the insanity defense. I don't think it is possible for these disorders to\
    \ be somehow separate from the self. \n\nWhat makes a mental disorder? How does\
    \ it differ from a characteristic? You could make the argument that mental disorders\
    \ are caused by physical abnormalities. However all thoughts are caused by physical\
    \ brain changes. Also these physical changes might cause an increase in IQ which\
    \ isn't a disorder. \n\nYou could argue that mental disorders must negatively\
    \ effect the one who suffers from them. I think there is no precedent that all\
    \ character traits must be positive. Furthermore, antisocial personality disorder\
    \ may be a benefit to some who have it. \n\nYou could argue that mental disorders\
    \ interfere with one's ability to conform to social norms and adopt pro-social\
    \ behavior (this would catch our Antisocial Personality Disorder people). However\
    \ under this circumstance all murderers could claim insanity. Also, social attitudes\
    \ are arbitrary. Homosexuality was once a disorder but society began to accept\
    \ it and seemed to acknowledge that we had in fact been mistaken this whole time\
    \ and are now enlightened. \n\nI don't have a formal argument. In the interest\
    \ of philosophy I posit that I am doubting the positive claim that mental disorders\
    \ are separate from the self and in some way significant beyond arbitrary societal\
    \ constructs. I think it is much more likely that psychiatry destroys those pieces\
    \ of the self that are convenient to remove based on society's standards.\n\n\
    As an aside I acknowledge that the suffering felt by those afflicted with mental\
    \ illness is very real and I do not mean to suggest that their pain is not real\
    \ or significant.  "

    I''m [Chris Surprenant, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of
    New Orleans](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/3lxw4b/im_chris_surprenant_philosophy_university_of_new/).


    Are you a high school student interested in philosophy? Recently we received a
    grant that has allowed us to offer for-college-credit philosophy courses online
    to high-achieving high school students.


    This summer, we''ll be offering two courses: Introduction to Philosophy and Philosophy
    of Law. Students participating in the program can take one or both courses. There
    are no prerequisites and high-achieving students with no background in philosophy
    are encouraged to participate.


    Courses are a mixture of both recorded lectures and live discussion sections,
    held once a week over Adobe Connect (no need to purchase anything). Students also
    participate in discussion during the week over the course message board, have
    access to all University of New Orleans academic resources, and received a UNO
    email address.


    The cost to participate is $120 per student, per course. Completing the course
    successfully will earn you 3 academic credits through the University of New Orleans.
    Credits earned through UNO are usually transferrable to other universities without
    a problem.


    To qualify, you must: (1)currently be enrolled in a high school in the United
    States (and receive approval from your high school to participate--we can help
    with that) or part of a registered homeschooling program; (2)have a minimum cumulative
    high school GPA of 2.5 or better; AND (3)Have taken one of the following tests
    and earned at least the listed minimum score: ACT or PLAN: 18 English and 19 math;
    SAT: 450 English and 460 math; PSAT: 45 English and 46 math; COMPASS: 74 Writing
    and 40 Algebra.


    To register or find out more about this program, visit http://www.uno.edu/tocqueville-project/high-school-dual-enrollment-program.aspx.


    If you would like to apply to participate in the program, please complete the
    form on our website. Courses are capped at 15 students per section. Spots are
    not considered to be filled until a student completes the registration process
    and enrolls in the course.


    Have questions? Please post here and I''ll respond as quickly as I can.


    Thanks, as always, to the moderators for allowing us to advertise what I think
    is a great program to expose high school students to philosophy and allow them
    to earn college credit at a fraction of the usual cost.


    Kind regards,


    Chris Surprenant'

  selftext: "Sometimes when I tell people I study philosophy, they ask me to give\
    \ an example of what I have studied. I've always rambled on about something specific\
    \ that interests me, but I recently realized that I can use this opportunity to\
    \ better the world. What is a philosophical argument that could either benefit\
    \ someone's life or cause someone to behave in a way that benefits others? Further,\
    \ how can you make the argument in a way that is comprehensible and convincing\
    \ to a layperson?\n\nI'll take a stance (although unsure) so that I don't violate\
    \ the rules. I think that one very important argument is that one should never\
    \ wish bad for someone because our intuitive sense of moral culpability is based\
    \ on a flawed conception of free will. The average person believes that people\
    \ who do bad things *deserve* to suffer. I think this is a very damaging view\
    \ because it causes a lot of unnecessary cruelty and anger. For example, the prison\
    \ system in America is largely based on the principle of punishing people for\
    \ their crimes rather than disincentivizing criminal activity and rehabilitating\
    \ criminals. I also think that people's anger others, and especially the desire\
    \ for revenge, relies on this mistaken view.\n\nThat being said, it isn't an easy\
    \ argument to make because free will is a really tricky concept. I've had the\
    \ best luck by reducing the universe to particles and causation. I compare the\
    \ universe to a pool table, with each particle compared to a ball, and the big\
    \ bang compared to the break. Just as the position of the ball is determined at\
    \ every moment the moment the cue hits the cue ball, the position of every particle\
    \ at every point in time is determined at the moment the big bang occurs. (Obligatory\
    \ hand wave at quantum physics\u2014it doesn't really impact the argument, so\
    \ I'm going to ignore it. Most people won't catch you on this.)\n\nOnce you establish\
    \ this (usually not too hard with educated people), explain that people are really\
    \ just a collection of a bunch of particles; every action that a person makes\
    \ is describable in terms of moving particles, and those movements are all predetermined.\
    \ (At this point, if they pull the quantum card, you can say \"predetermined,\
    \ or determined by random quantum effects, neither of which 'you' have any effect\
    \ on\"). Because of this, murderers were doomed to commit their crimes the moment\
    \ they entered the world. If anything, they should be pitied because for our society\
    \ to function we must punish them.\n\nI then explain how free will and moral culpability\
    \ still exist in some sense, and how we must rely on these concepts for society\
    \ to function. Then I ask, if a murderer was destined to kill innocent people\
    \ from the moment of their birth, is there any reason to make them suffer more\
    \ than necessary? It is unfortunate that particles interact in a way such that\
    \ conscious beings hurt each other. However, the consciousness associated with\
    \ a set of particles has no causative effect on its associated set of particles.*\
    \ Thus, there is no reason to punish the consciousness for its particles' actions.\
    \ When we wish bad for a person, (e.g. \"Hitler should be in hell\"), we are really\
    \ wishing bad for the consciousness, not the particles. This is unfair and illogical.\n\
    \n___\nThat's a rough outline anyway. If any of you have any ways to improve upon\
    \ the argument, or problems with the argument, please tell me. I'm also curious\
    \ to hear what arguments you think might be more important.\n\n*This needs more\
    \ explanation but I don't have time to lay it all out now\u2014that's another\
    \ topic."

  selftext: "As [previously announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/4zph5n/fall_2016_rphilosophy_ama_series/),\
    \ /r/philosophy is hosting an AMA series this fall semester which kicked off last\
    \ Tuesday with an [AMA by Caspar Hare (MIT)](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/50c7yp/i_am_caspar_hare_professor_of_philosophy_at_mit/).\
    \ Check out our [series announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/4zph5n/fall_2016_rphilosophy_ama_series/)\
    \ to see all the upcoming AMAs this semester.\n\nWe continue our series this upcoming\
    \ Wednesday with [Kevin Scharp](http://kevinscharp.com/), Reader in the philosophy\
    \ department at the University of St Andrews. Hear it from Professor Scharp himself:\n\
    \nI grew up in St. Louis, Missouri and attended Washington University, where I\
    \ earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics in 1996. I decided on a career\
    \ in philosophy late in my undergraduate career, so after graduation I moved to\
    \ Milwaukee, Wisconsin to attend the master\u2019s program in philosophy at the\
    \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee. I wrote my thesis on William James with\
    \ Robert Schwartz as my advisor. Upon completion, I was undecided on whether I\
    \ wanted to focus on analytic or continental philosophy.  Instead of choosing\
    \ between them, I decided on the PhD program at Northwestern, which, at that time,\
    \ was strong in both traditions. While at Northwestern I settled on analytic philosophy,\
    \ but by then, the analytic wing of the department had collapsed. I transferred\
    \ to the University of Pittsburgh, where I wrote a dissertation under the supervision\
    \ of Robert Brandom.  Once the dissertation was defended in 2005, I took a position\
    \ as an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University, where most of my teaching\
    \ responsibilities were at the Marion campus.  In 2010, I was promoted to Associate\
    \ Professor, and in 2014 promoted to Full Professor. My partner, Alison Duncan\
    \ Kerr (who is also a philosopher) and I have three children: a five year old\
    \ and twin girls who just turned one. Our family recently moved from Columbus\
    \ to Scotland so Ali and I can take up positions at the University of St. Andrews.\
    \ I'm now a Reader in the philosophy department and a member of the management\
    \ committee for Arche, the philosophical research center for logic, language,\
    \ metaphysics and epistemology.\n\nMy areas of specialization (what I research)\
    \ are philosophy of language, logic, metaphysics, philosophy of science, and history\
    \ of analytic philosophy. \n\nI have done the most work in logic and the philosophy\
    \ of language where my primary focus is the concept of truth and the paradoxes\
    \ associated with it. I have a book with Oxford University Press that was published\
    \ in 2013 entitled *Replacing Truth*. \n\nYou can order it through OUP with a\
    \ **30% discount** courtesy of OUP sponsoring this AMA series by following this\
    \ [direct link](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/9780199653850/?cc=us&lang=en&promocode=AAFLYG6).\
    \ You can also view the **first chapter of the book open-access** for the next\
    \ 3 weeks courtesy of OUP by [following this link](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199653850.001.0001/acprof-9780199653850-chapter-2).\
    \ \n\nThe following is a short description of the book.\n\n>I propose a theory\
    \ of the nature and logic of truth on which truth is an inconsistent concept that\
    \ should be replaced for certain theoretical purposes.  The book opens with an\
    \ overview of work on the nature of truth (e.g., correspondence theories, deflationism),\
    \ work on the liar and related paradoxes, and a comprehensive scheme for combining\
    \ these two literatures into a unified study of the concept truth.  Truth is best\
    \ understood as an inconsistent concept, and I propose a detailed theory of inconsistent\
    \ concepts that can be applied to the case of truth.  Truth also happens to be\
    \ a useful concept, but its inconsistency inhibits its utility; as such, it should\
    \ be replaced with consistent concepts that can do truth\u2019s job without giving\
    \ rise to paradoxes.  I offer a pair of replacements, which I dub ascending truth\
    \ and descending truth, along with an axiomatic theory of them and a new kind\
    \ of possible-worlds semantics for this theory.  As for the nature of truth, I\
    \ develop Davidson\u2019s idea that it is best understood as the core of a measurement\
    \ system for rational phenomena (e.g., belief, desire, and meaning).  The book\
    \ finishes with a semantic theory that treats truth predicates as assessment-sensitive\
    \ (i.e., their extension is relative to a context of assessment), and demonstration\
    \ of how this theory solves the problems posed by the liar and other paradoxes.\
    \ \n\nTwo major recent papers associated with this project are \u201CTruth, the\
    \ Liar, and Relativism,\u201D The Philosophical Review, 2013, and \u201CTruth,\
    \ Revenge, and Internalizability,\u201D Erkenntnis, 2014.  The former contains\
    \ the main proposal defended in Replacing Truth, and the latter develops my views\
    \ on the difficult topic of revenge paradoxes (where an approach to the liar paradox\
    \ itself generates a new paradox that is structurally similar to the liar).  All\
    \ my papers are available on my website: [kevinscharp.com](http://kevinscharp.com/).\n\
    \nIn addition, I have another book under contract with Oxford University Press\
    \ that introduces undergraduates, graduate students, and professional philosophers\
    \ to the literature on truth.\n\nI also work on philosophy of science, most significantly\
    \ on measurement theory and scientific change.  \nI just finished a short book\
    \ (45,000 words) on semantics for \u2018reason\u2019 and similar locutions entitled\
    \ *Semantics for Reasons*. It is coauthored with Bryan Weaver. Reasons have been\
    \ an area of tremendous interest over the last few decades and this topic seems\
    \ to be getting even more attention lately.  Semantics for normative locutions\
    \ like \u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 have also been very popular, yet\
    \ the semantic features of \u2018reason\u2019 are poorly understood. Indeed, many\
    \ aspects of the contemporary discussion are based at least in part on faulty\
    \ assumptions about \u2018reason\u2019. Utilizing myriad tools from linguistics\
    \ and the philosophy of language, we argue that the count noun, \u2018reason\u2019\
    \ is not ambiguous at all, and that it is context dependent in a certain way.\
    \ In particular, the content of \u2018reason\u2019 in a context of utterance is\
    \ determined by one of eight possible questions under discussion in that context.\
    \ We use this reasons contextualism to show that the worry over the ontology of\
    \ reasons debated by mentalists and factualists is a pseudo-problem. Moreover,\
    \ our semantics solves several outstanding problems associated with reasons, like\
    \ the miners paradox. In addition, it provides a framework for a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the relations between many of the most significant reasons\
    \ distinctions, including: internal / external, agent-neutral / agent-relative,\
    \ objective / subjective, normative / motivating / explanatory, practical / theoretical,\
    \ justifying / requiring, and pro tanto / conclusive.  We explain in detail how\
    \ our semantics for reasons locutions explains each of these distinctions and\
    \ the relationships between them.  We go on to lay out how our account impacts\
    \ five major issues in the philosophical discussion of reasons: the ontology of\
    \ reasons, the wrong kind of reasons (e.g., being offered a million pounds to\
    \ believe that 1=0), the complex relationship between reasons and human rationality,\
    \ and the \u201Creasons-first\u201D movement.\n\nOne future project is a book\
    \ based on a series of lectures I gave in St. Andrews in 2015.  The title is *Replacing\
    \ Philosophy*.  The topic of the book is philosophical methodology \u2013 in particular\
    \ it develops the methodology practiced in Replacing Truth for all of philosophy.\
    \  I have come to think that this kind of philosophical methodology can and should\
    \ play a much larger role in philosophical theorizing.  Indeed, I have come to\
    \ think that most, if not all commonly discussed philosophical concepts are inconsistent\u2014\
    some in the same way as truth and others in more subtle ways with one another.\
    \  As such I have come to think that philosophy is, for the most part, the study\
    \ of what have turned out to be inconsistent concepts. These concepts include\
    \ truth, knowledge, nature, meaning, virtue, explanation, essence, causation,\
    \ validity, rationality, freedom, necessity, person, beauty, belief, goodness,\
    \ time, space, justice, etc. Conceptual engineering is taking a critical and active\
    \ attitude toward one\u2019s own conceptual scheme.  Many of us already think\
    \ that we should take this critical and active attitude toward our beliefs.  We\
    \ should subject them to a battery of objections and see how well we can reply\
    \ to those objections.  If a belief does not fare well in this process, then that\
    \ is a good indicator that it should be changed.  By doing this, one can sculpt\
    \ and craft a belief system of one\u2019s own rather that just living one\u2019\
    s life with beliefs borrowed from one\u2019s ancestors.  The central idea of conceptual\
    \ engineering is that one ought to take the same critical attitude toward one\u2019\
    s concepts. Likewise, if a concept does not fare well under critical scrutiny,\
    \ the active attitude kicks in and one crafts new concepts that do the work one\
    \ wants without giving rise to the problems inherent in the old ones.  By doing\
    \ this, one can sculpt and craft a conceptual repertoire of one\u2019s own rather\
    \ that just living one\u2019s life with concepts borrowed from one\u2019s ancestors.\
    \ The book opens with substantive chapters on conceptual engineering and philosophical\
    \ methodology.  In these chapters, the ideas described above are worked out. \
    \ Then there are five \u201Capplication\u201D chapters.\n\nAnother future project\
    \ is a book based on the debate I had with William Lane Craig at The Ohio State\
    \ University on 24 February 2016 on \"Is there Evidence for God?\" I presented\
    \ the secular perspective and plan on turning the presentation (and my replies\
    \ to the onslaught of objections I've received) into a short book entitled *21st\
    \ Century Atheism*. It covers confidence levels, explanation, divine psychology,\
    \ love, the weakness objection, religious experience, and apologetics.\n\nHere\
    \ is my CV: [http://kevinscharp.com/Scharp-CV.pdf](http://kevinscharp.com/Scharp-CV.pdf)\n\

  selftext: 'I just came across [this article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/#3.2)
    on the relation between cellular automata (CAs) and free will. As a brief summary,
    CAs are computational structures that consist of a set of rules and a grid in
    which each cell has a state. At each step, the same rules are applied to each
    cell, and the rules depend only on the neighbors of the cell and the cell itself.
    This concept is philosophically appealing because the universe itself seems to
    be quite similar to a CA: Each elementary particle corresponds to a cell, other
    particles within reach correspond to neighbors and the laws of physics (the rules)
    dictate how the state (position, charge, spin etc.) of an elementary particle
    changes depending on other particles.


    Let us just assume for now that this assumption is correct. What Stephen Wolfram
    brings forward is the idea that the concept of free will is sufficiently captured
    by *computational irreducibility* (CI). A computation that is irreducibile means
    that there is no shortcut in the computation, i.e. the outcome cannot be predicted
    without going through the computation step by step. For example, when a water
    bottle falls from a table, we don''t need to go through the evolution of all [~10^(26)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number+of+atoms+in+one+liter+of+water)
    atoms involved in the immediate physical interactions of the falling bottle (let
    alone possible interactions with all other elementary particles in the universe).
    Instead, our minds can simply recall from experience how the pattern of a falling
    object evolves. We can do so much faster than the universe goes through the gravitational
    acceleration and collision computations so that we can catch the bottle before
    it falls. This is an example of computational reducibility (even though the reduction
    here is only an approximation).


    On the other hand, it might be impossible to go through the computation that happens
    inside our brains before we perform an action. There are [experimental results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will#Overview)
    in which they insert an electrode into a human brain and predict actions before
    the subjects become aware of them. However, it seems quite hard (and currently
    impossible) to predict all the computation that happens subconsciously. That means,
    as long as our computers are not fast enough to predict our brains, we have free
    will. If computers will always remain slower than all the computations that occur
    inside our brains, then we will always have free will. However, if computers are
    powerful enough one day, we will lose our free will. A computer could then reliably
    finish the things we were about to do or prevent them before we could even think
    about them. In cases of a crime, the computer would then be accountable due to
    denial of assistance.


    Edit: [This is the section](https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-750-text)
    in NKS that the SEoP article above refers to.'

    \ the University of New Orleans.\n\nAre you a high school student interested in\
    \ taking a for-college-credit philosophy course next spring?\n\nFor the past year\
    \ and a half we've been offering for-credit courses online in philosophy to outstanding,\
    \ self-motivated high school students throughout the country. The course is a\
    \ mix of lecture (narrated podcast) and discussion (held live over Skype one night\
    \ a week).\n\nThis spring, we'll be offering an ethics class as part of this program.\
    \ The course covers both ideas in the history of moral philosophy and the application\
    \ of these theoretical positions to contemporary philosophical issues. There are\
    \ no prerequisites and high-achieving students with no background in philosophy\
    \ are encouraged to participate.\n\nThe cost to participate is $120 per student.\
    \ Completing the course successfully will earn you 3 academic credits through\
    \ the University of New Orleans.\n\nTo qualify, you must: \n(1)currently be enrolled\
    \ in a high school in the United States (and receive approval from your high school\
    \ to participate--we can help with that) or part of a registered homeschooling\
    \ program; \n(2)have a minimum cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 or better;\n\
    AND (3)Have taken one of the following tests and earned at least the listed minimum\
    \ score: ACT or PLAN: 18 English and 19 math; SAT: 450 English and 460 math; PSAT:\
    \ 45 English and 46 math; COMPASS: 74 Writing and 40 Algebra.\n\nYou can find\
    \ out more about this program by visiting http://www.uno.edu/tocqueville-project/high-school-dual-enrollment-program.aspx,\
    \ and more about the UNO Philosophy Department, our courses, and our other programs\
    \ by visiting http://phil.uno.edu, including our online degree program that is\
    \ open to everyone (not just high school students).\n\nIf you would like to apply\
    \ to participate in the program, please email me at csurpren[at]uno.edu.\n\nHave\
    \ questions? Please post here and I'll respond as quickly as I can.\n\nThanks,\
    \ as always, to the moderators for allowing us to advertise what I think is a\
    \ great program to expose high school students to philosophy and allow them to\
    \ earn college credit at a fraction of the usual cost.\n\nAlso, some of you have\
    \ asked why I have posted this every few weeks. This program is small--after our\
    \ screening, we had only 9 students participate this semester. We want all of\
    \ the students to self-select in and we know that there are lots of active hs\
    \ students who are interested in philosophy here. If you know anyone who may be\
    \ interested, please pass this information along to them.\n\nKind regards, \n\n\

    I''ve always wondered about this. Our brains must need some sort of stimuli input
    to form thoughts. Whether it is a sense, a memory, a previous thought, or biological
    function, etc., your brain can only react to what it''s given. If you take all
    that away, what else is there?


    Ultimately I see this as sort of a conundrum with Descartes'' "cogito ergo sum"
    How can you think when there is nothing to think of? And if you cannot think then
    do you exist?'
  title: Scientists have just grown a human brain the equivalent in size to that of
    a 9-week-old fetus. If that brain was hypothetically able to develop into a functioning
    brain of a child or even that of an adult, yet receive no stimuli whatsoever,
    could it be conscious or capable of any sort of thought?

    \ me on how I don't read enough and that I don't have an expansive-enough vocabulary.\n\
    \nThe main argument he gave was that if you expand your inner database of words,\
    \ you then gain the possibility of describe the ideas that are unique to those\
    \ words. For example, many subtle differences between generally accepted synonyms\
    \ gives you the capability to describe an idea in new detail. He also said that\
    \ **Ideas cannot exist without the proper words**.\n\nThe last part is what I\
    \ have trouble with the most. I feel that the human brain can function without\
    \ language. That we can think, act, and feel purely on \"feelings\" and intuitions.\
    \ I think that ideas can exist without words because when we speak to one another\
    \ we are merely translating our ideas into words. If you think only in words,\
    \ then you do this subconsciously. I say this because I have tried to think without\
    \ words, and I'm fairly sure it was effective (first off, it seemed alot faster\
    \ and more intuitive), but its also very possible that I fooled myself. \n\nIf\
    \ you do respond do this, I would greatly appreciate if you could back your reasoning\
    \ up with any scientific articles (if there have been any on this subject) because\
    \ I want to get back to my Dad on this, and I'd like to have something legitimate\
    \ to back up my arguments with. \n\nAlso, I apologize for my ignorance - I don't\
    \ know if this is one of the biggest currently unanswered questions or if this\
    \ has been debated over the centuries. I know this relates to epistemology but\
    \ other than that I have no idea. I also apologize if this is too open a question\

  selftext: "Hello!\n\nI'm Chris Surprenant, an assistant professor of philosophy\
    \ at the University of New Orleans, where I direct the Alexis de Tocqueville Project\
    \ in Law, Liberty, and Morality.\n\nAre you a high school student interested in\
    \ taking a for-college-credit philosophy course next year?\n\nThis year, we received\
    \ a grant to launch an exciting new initiative of teaching free, for-credit philosophy\
    \ courses in local high schools. Next year, we are considering expanding this\
    \ program outside of New Orleans, and offering for-credit philosophy courses to\
    \ high school students online across the country.\n\nThe course(s) will focus\
    \ on human well-being and the good life, and will be equivalent to what would\
    \ be covered in an Introduction to Philosophy course or an Introduction to Ethics\
    \ course. Students will receive college credit through UNO's dual-enrollment program.\n\
    \nIn the fall, students would register for UNO's PHIL 1000 - Introduction to Philosophy\
    \ (3 credits), and, in the spring, for PHIL 2201 - Ethics (3 credits).\n\nThe\
    \ format for the course has yet to be finalized, but it will likely include some\
    \ asynchronous components (recorded lectures and an online discussion forum) and\
    \ a synchronous component (live discussions online using Adobe Connect or similar\
    \ software). \n\nThe total cost for each course would be less than $150, which\
    \ would include UNO's dual-registration fee, UNO's online course fee, and the\
    \ course texts (purchased from Amazon or somewhere else).\n\nTo qualify, you must:\
    \ (1)currently be enrolled in a high school in the United States (and receive\
    \ approval from your high school to participate--we can help with that) or part\
    \ of a registered homeschooling program; (2)have a minimum cumulative high school\
    \ GPA of 2.5 or better; AND (3)Have taken one of the following test and received\
    \ minimum test scores of: ACT or PLAN: 18 English and 19 math; SAT: 450 English\
    \ and 460 math; PSAT: 45 English and 46 math; COMPASS: 74 Writing and 40 Algebra\n\
    \nYou can find out more about the UNO Philosophy Department, our courses, and\
    \ our programs by visiting our website, http://phil.uno.edu.\n\nIf you would like\
    \ to be added to the list of interested students or would like to learn more,\
    \ please email me at csurpren[at]uno.edu.\n\nKind regards,\n\nChris Surprenant\n\
    \n-\nNote: I posted this same message over a week ago. There was a great response\
    \ and we will be contacting everyone who replied with more information next week.\
    \ (If you emailed me before, you do not need to email me again.) But we wanted\
    \ to advertise it once more in case folks missed the post last week. Thanks again\
    \ to the moderators for allowing us to notify you of this opportunity here."

  selftext: "Throughout my education in philosophy (BA,MA), there is one book which\
    \ I've shamelessly returned to, over and over, like a battered dog returning to\
    \ its once-gentle master. \n\nThat book is [The Myth of Sisyphus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Sisyphus).\
    \ \n\nTo summarize: Camus saw absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict\
    \ or a \"divorce\" between two ideals. On the one hand, we have man's desire for\
    \ significance, meaning and clarity--and the silent, cold and uncaring universe\
    \ on the other. \n\nIn light of this paradox, which affects all humankind equally,\
    \ Camus offers three choices: \n\n1. Suicide \n2. Philosophical suicide (Sublimating\
    \ personal beliefs for religious doctrine) \n3. Accepting the absurd and creating\
    \ (or pursuing, in Kierkegaard's case) meaning of one's own. \n\nProvided you\
    \ agree with the axioms (which are mostly allegorical, anyway) that Camus works\
    \ from, it becomes clear that his resum\xE9 of options is cogent and realistic.\
    \ After all, if life offers no inherent meaning, what choices lie beyond suicide,\
    \ religion or another abitrary ideology? \n\nNot only is the point well made,\
    \ but I'm very much a fan of Camus' technical approach to the philosophical problem\
    \ posed by \"The Absurd.\" \n\nCamus sees an uneqivocal challenge in the form\
    \ of life's absurdity, and demands an unequival decision. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nArmed with some conceptual background, I'd like to explore a new theory of mine.\
    \ \n\nWhile humanity may always be plagued by \"cosmic existential angst,\" the\
    \ search for meaning in an uncaring universe, we've increasingly fallen victim\
    \ to what I'll call \"terrestrial existential angst,\" the search for meaning\
    \ in a collapsing world.  \n\nThis new angst springs from a paradox, similar to\
    \ that of Sisyphus. On the one hand, we have man's desire to live and survive,\
    \ and on the other, we have the growing likelihood of civilizational self-destruction.\
    \ \n\nIt's no secret that the future of our modern post-industrial world is in\
    \ question. \n\nWhereas prior generations only had to contend with one existentially-threatening\
    \ problem at a time (nuclear proliferation, o-zone, militaristic regimes), our\
    \ current global society is attempting to negociate dozens of potentially-world-ending\
    \ problems*, all at once. \n\nDeforestation, ocean acidification, climate change,\
    \ anti-biotic-resistant diseases, peak oil,  and resource over-exploitation are\
    \ just a few challenges we will have to confront in the coming years. And I haven't\
    \ even mentioned the market-instability and growing likelihood of regional conflict\
    \ that these challenges can precipitate.  \n\nIf *you're not* convinced that human\
    \ society is due for collapse, assume you are, for the sake of this exercise.\
    \ \n\nIf *you do believe* that our global civilization may eventually or is already\
    \ coming to an end...\n\nYou have three choices: \n\n1. Suicide \n2. Nihilism/hedonism/self-interest\n\
    3. Revolution \n\nAre these valid choices? If not, what other choices could one\
    \ pursue, in light of our present circumstances? \n\nAnd if you agree with my\
    \ conception of choices, what would *you* choose? \n\nTL;DR: Our post-industrial\
    \ civilization is ending. What do? \n\n*Disclaimer: Whenever I use the expression\
    \ \"world-ending,\" I'm being hyperbolic. Any civilizational collapse that occurs\
    \ at this point, will (almost) certainly leave segments of Earth's population\
    \ unharmed. However, it is very likely that those survivors (bereft of readily-available\
    \ resources, expertise or structure) will *ever* reach the same heights as their\
    \ forbearers. So if the modern, global industrial system collapses... there will\
    \ be survivors, but they won't last long. "

  selftext: "From Section 5 of *The Birth of Tragedy\":\n\n\"It is only as an *aesthetic\
    \ phenomenon* that life and existence are eternally justified.\"\n\nWhy is this\
    \ uplifting to me? Well, do you ever think about life and everything, and come\
    \ to the rational conclusion that it's all entirely pointless? I do. I think too\
    \ much about everything, I see hypocrisy everywhere, including myself, and I probably\
    \ couldn't be more misanthropic if I tried. \n\nBut what Nietzsche says here,\
    \ I think, is that you don't *have* to convince yourself there is a point to it\
    \ all. You don't need to. There is an antidote to the feelings that come from\
    \ the realisation that you're alone in the universe. And it's simply art, and\
    \ music. Beauty.\n\nI don't know if this works for anyone else, but when I feel\
    \ like shit, I can think about this quote and remind myself that beauty exists\

  selftext: 'Physicist Murray Gell-Mann argues why beautiful and elegant theories
    tend to be correct. (Spoiler: He argues that the correctness of elegant theories
    is due to nature''s self-similarity.  "Nature conforms to herself", and so exploring
    the symmetries and structure of a theory often indicates the correct description
    of phenomena outside the scope of the theory).


    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk


    Highlights


    [3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=3m15s): He notes that a beautiful
    and elegant theory is more likely to be right than ones that aren''t.  "If you''re
    looking for the right theory, look for the beautiful one".  He goes on to talk
    about how the partial theory of the weak force he and others discovered did not
    agree with important experiments, but it was so beautiful, they published it anyway.  Later,
    it was discovered that the experiments were wrong.


    [5:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=05m58s) He raises the question
    of why beautiful theories are more likely to be right, and whether it is due to
    the way in which humans construct theories, or due to some deeper pattern of nature.  He
    argues that the laws of physics are not just constructs of the human mind.


    [14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=14m30s) : The history of
    the universe is co-determined by three things.


    (1) A fundamental quantum theory of particles and forces.


    (2) An unimaginably long sequence of fundamentally random events.


    (3) The initial conditions of the universe.


    The press regularly talks about a theory of everything, but it would not be a
    theory of everything, as it would not determine the history of the universe.  It
    can only assign probabilities to possible histories of the universe, given some
    initial conditions.


    [19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=19m59s): He proposes an
    explanation for why beauty and elegance is a successful criteria for guessing
    correct theories.  As physicists go to shorter and shorter distances, they notice
    that the manifestations of the laws at different scales are approximately self-similar.  "Nature
    Conformable to Herself".  So the explanations of new phenomena naturally emerge
    from old theories.


    Newton found that the gravitational force is proportional to 1/d^2.  The electrical
    force was found to obey the same law.


    In physics, a system exhibits symmetry if there is an operation you can perform
    on the system that doesn''t change it.  The theory of electromagnetism is symmetrical
    under all rotations.


    Einstein looked at the symmetries of electromagnetism, and applied them more broadly
    to mechanics.  This is special relativity.


    [26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=26m15s): He shows a slide
    of maxwell''s equations in their original form, in vector form, and in their relativistic
    form.  By taking advantage of symmetries, equations can be expressed more elegantly.


    [28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=28m40s) Frank Yang and Robert
    Mills took advantage of even higher symmetries to generalise Maxwell''s equation.  They
    did not know what this generalisation implied, but it was a beautiful theory,
    whatever it was.  It was later discovered that it was the theory of the strong
    nuclear interaction (chromodynamics).  It is an example of a gauge theory.  Gauge
    theories are theories where the symmetry of a theory dictates its form.


    [34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=34m55s): He presents Newton''s
    musings on nature''s self-similarity.  Nature "is consonant to herself.  She observes
    the same method in regulating the motions of smaller bodies which she doth in
    regulating those of the greater."


    [37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=37m45s) This self-similar
    property of nature is not a construct of the human mind.  It is a property that
    any intelligent life would discover.


    [38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=38m23s) He remarks that
    Newton, in his time off, worked on his theory of gravitation, the laws of motion,
    calculus, and the composition of white light.  He encourages research students
    to emulate Newton''s productivity.


    [40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=40m18s) Eugene Wigner wrote
    an article on the [unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html),
    which may be a consequence of Nature''s self-similarity.


    [46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qiJTNKTihk&t=46m53s): Questions.  He
    briefly discusses his "decoherent histories" approach to quantum mechanics (my
    favourite approach btw) and compares it to the Many-worlds interpretation.

  selftext: 'The recent post on the front page (in /r/atheism for some reason) about
    rape and rape culture got me thinking about two truths that don''t seem to add
    up:


    1) Someone (usually a woman) who is inebriated cannot legally consent to sex in
    most (all?) states. Perhaps more importantly, most people think that it would
    be morally base to take advantage of someone in such a state.


    2) Someone who operates a motor vehicle while inebriated is liable for driving
    under the influence.


    Essentially, we have on the one hand an argument for loss of autonomy, and on
    the other we have an affirmation of autonomy: you are not responsible for your
    actions in one instance, but are in the other.


    In fact, a common argument -- that someone was responsible for the choices that
    put them into a state of inebriation -- is valid for the drunk driving situation,
    but viewed as tasteless and reprehensible in the sex situation. We cannot argue
    that a woman who decided to get as drunk as she did has a responsibility for her
    actions through transitivity of identity/autonomy.


    So, to cut to the chase: why is this the case? It seems to me either you have
    autonomy or you don''t, and we shouldn''t just get to cherry pick based on what''s
    convenient. Why am I wrong?


    [Addition: Some have argued that coercion is the defining distinction -- that
    is, the sexual partner can coerce someone into an act they might otherwise not
    commit, but a car cannot -- but I can imagine a situation where a friend suggests,
    "C''mon man!  You''re not drunk.  Besides, we need a ride home!"  This would seem
    to be identical in terms of its coercive nature, yet the driver would still be
    responsible.]'

  selftext: 'I''ve been reading the Nicomachean Ethics and at one point, Aristotle
    makes the claim that you have to have some intellectual virtue to be a good person.  It
    seems to me that he is saying that you can''t be an idiot and be a good person
    because you need to know why something is the right thing, not just that it is.  Do
    you all think that this is correct?  To a degree I think Aristotle is right, for
    example, take a small child; they often do what their parents tell them to do
    (like give money to a homeless person) BUT they don''t know why they are doing
    it.  On the other hand, it seems that an implication of Aristotle''s view point
    is that if you are wrong about why then you aren''t a good person.  Could there
    be a middle in ground in that you have to have an understanding of why it''s the
    right action (beyond simply somebody is telling you to do it) even if you are
    wrong?  Let me know what y''all think. '

    \ or chip or whatever put in your brain, thereby increasing your intelligence\
    \ and giving you instant access to the internet and huge databases etc.. We hypothesized\
    \ that, as a consequence of this, your consciousness, partly fused with the AI\
    \ that had been introduced to your brain, would be able to be uploaded somewhere,\
    \ thereby extending your lifespan (if we were to assume that your identity would\
    \ persist) and perhaps even rendering you immortal.\n\n\nSo, as there is usually\
    \ plenty of discussion regarding identity and consciousness in this subreddit,\
    \ I am interested in hearing some of your perspectives.\n\n- Do you think fusing\
    \ with an AI in the way described above would change your identity in such a way\
    \ that you would no longer be the same person?\n\n- Assuming that this fusion\
    \ would in fact change you quite considerably, perhaps thereby even losing certain\
    \ aspects of your personality and humanity, would you still go ahead with it?\n\
    \n\nPersonally, I would definitely go ahead with it! Because of my rather pessimistic\
    \ existentialist view of human life, I feel there should be room for improvement.\
    \ If our existence is indeed absurd and we are so terribly flawed as products\
    \ of evolution that are living in a radically different environment than the one\
    \ we evolved in, why hang on that frail humanity? Yeah, I'd swallow that pill.\
    \ How about you?"

  selftext: "Revenge porn is when, usually after a break-up, a man or woman shares\
    \ sexually explicit photos or videos of significant others with people who had\
    \ not been intended to see it.  Everyone's first instinct: what a classless, disgusting\
    \ thing to do to someone.  Go ahead and acknowledge that, then set it aside it\
    \ for now.\n\nThis post questions whether or not we should consider it a criminal\
    \ act.  The legal and philosophical arguments tend to escape critical analysis\
    \ because we have such a negative first reaction to revenge porn.  Unfortunately,\
    \ I think that's left the current system severely underdeveloped and would like\
    \ to propose an alternative system of philosophical justification and, consequently,\
    \ laws.  This has new urgency because [in the last year a dozen states passed\
    \ criminal statutes against revenge porn.](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/law-firm-founds-project-to-fight-revenge-porn/?target=comments&hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&modref=HPCommentsRefer&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0)\
    \ Unfortunately, I dont' think these criminal charges are likely to stick unless\
    \ we re-examine the arguments.\n\nLet's start by trimming the category of revenge\
    \ porn down to the most troublesome content.  We can make two big distinctions:\
    \ the first being content stolen vs. willingly given.  Media stolen by some criminal\
    \ act is illegal because of the way it was acquired, not by its content, as in\
    \ the [celebrity nude scandal](http://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/09/24/can-you-be-arrested-or-sued-for-viewing-or-sharing-nude-celebrity-photos-here-are-some-relevant-laws-2/).\
    \  However, if someone personally didn't acquire a nude photo by committing a\
    \ criminal act, then they could continue to distribute it until a court placed\
    \ an injunction to stop them, and then it would be criminal to distribute anyways.\
    \  Where does that leave a photo that was given willingly from one person to another?\n\
    \nThe second distinction is content created without the knowledge or permission\
    \ of the person depicted.  It is not illegal to photograph other people without\
    \ consent, with the exception of sexually explicit content.  This is because consent\
    \ is necessary to engage in any activity with another person that would be considered\
    \ of a sexual nature, and why producing sexually explicit images of people too\
    \ young or impaired to give \"consent\" in the eyes of the law is always criminal.\
    \  However, this says nothing of sexually explicit media given willingly.\n\n\
    That leaves a category that is harder to deal with legally: a sexually explicit\
    \ photo made by another person with permission or willingly given to another person.\
    \  Technically, we would then consider the sexually explicit photo or video to\
    \ become a commodity or intellectual property.  At the point that a boyfriend\
    \ or girlfriend gives such a photo to their significant other, it's difficult\
    \ to not see how that is a transfer of ownership, thereby giving the significant\
    \ other the ability to use the photo as they wish.\n\nLet's look at [Colorado's\
    \ statute in particular](http://www.hopkinsway.com/practice-areas/privacy-law/):\
    \ Colorado granted the person depicted automatic intellectual property rights\
    \ including being considered to have \"authored\" the content.  The standard they\
    \ are using is basically claiming the other person violated \"a reasonable expectation\
    \ that the images were intended to be kept private\" as a form of implicit agreement\
    \ in giving the sexually explicit media to someone else.  To violate that reasonable\
    \ expectation is then akin to contract-breaking.\n\nThis will almost certainly\
    \ be struck down by the supreme court as overly broad.  This is due to the recent\
    \ case of the [monkey selfie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie) which\
    \ resulted in the U.S. copyright office making clear that the \"author\" of the\
    \ creative work has the intellectual rights, and that author is the actual maker\
    \ of the images.  The depicted will have to demonstrate that they created the\
    \ image in the first place: aka a girl didn't simply let a boyfriend take a photo\
    \ or video of her.  The simple act of someone else taking the photo will throw\
    \ the current law and justification into utter turmoil.  \n\nAnother problem is\
    \ that the current supreme court may not be willing to abide default intellectual\
    \ control of nude photographs to the depicted.  Because, really, what is the philosophical\
    \ justification being given for creating a specific niche of intellectual property\
    \ law that works differently from all other intellectual property law?  Normally,\
    \ if a couple exchanged photos of mountains or each other with clothes on, there\
    \ would be no \"reasonable expectation\" to control the behavior of the recipients.\
    \  Yes, sharing sexual images has the potential to do great damage, but so does\
    \ any other number of photos or videos of people behaving badly that we would\
    \ not confer this protection to.  The argument needs to be more sophisticated\
    \ than it has been, and that's the hole I'd like to fill.\n\nLet us take a step\
    \ back to think about this issue a different way.  What's really consented to\
    \ in the creation of sexually explicit media?  The purpose of consent to sexual\
    \ activity is because we are allowing another person access to our bodies and\
    \ privacy, things too intimate to not require our consent to access.  This should\
    \ be made distinct from our image, which others are allowed to recreate in media\
    \ without consent.  The difference is that we have an expectation that consent\
    \ is ALWAYS required beyond a certain point when intimately interacting with our\
    \ bodies; be it for sexual, medicinal, or other purposes.  I propose that what\
    \ we need to ask is if sexually explicit photos and videos of ourselves fall into\
    \ this category, and then if we somehow consent to giving up the need for consent.\n\
    \nTo answer the first question: sexually explicit photos and videos absolutely\
    \ should still fall into this category.  They are effectively alternative routes\
    \ of access to our bodies besides our actual bodies.  That is their practical\
    \ and symbolic purpose.  To prove this, let us consider the alternative of considering\
    \ the images property instead and separate from the bodies they depict.  This\
    \ would tread dangerously close to objectification: the transformation of a person\
    \ into an object that can be owned, shared, sold, etc.  There's a rich history\
    \ of [feminist critique already on how pornographic images are objectifying](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/#PorObj).\
    \  Although those critiques originally revolved around the inequality of men as\
    \ consumers and women as the objectified, it still can inform us on this process\
    \ of objectification as well:\n\n> MacKinnon and Dworkin's understanding of objectification\
    \ is similar to Kant's. For both of them, like for Kant, objectification involves\
    \ treating a person, someone with humanity, as an object of merely instrumental\
    \ worth, and consequently reducing this person to the status of an object for\
    \ use. The objectified individual is made into a tool for others' sexual purposes.\
    \ Objectification, therefore, constitutes a serious harm to a person's humanity.\n\
    \nAlthough feminism is moving in a [pornography-tolerant direction](http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/mcelroy_17_4.html),\
    \ liberal feminism and sex-positive feminism both only defend it on the assumption\
    \ that there is consent.  Without consent, photos and videos of sexually explicit\
    \ nature are straight-forward objectification, both of men's and women's bodies.\
    \  This is the real sin of \"revenge porn,\" that it eliminates consent from the\
    \ sexually explicit materials distribution and thus becomes an act of objectification\
    \ for the sexual pleasure of the third party, inflicting all the harm on the depicted\
    \ and society that this objectification entails (not going into that here for\
    \ space).\n\nThis brings us to the second question: can or do we consent to giving\
    \ up our need for consent?  The answer should be a resolute \"No,\" specifically\
    \ to distributing a sexually explicit photo or video.  Just as a pornstar must\
    \ consent to the licensing and public distribution of their sexually explicit\
    \ material, so any redistribution of a private photo or video should require consent\
    \ of the depicted.  That is the crucial step that makes it a mutual sexual act\
    \ instead of objectification, and justifies a special category of \"intellectual\
    \ property\" for sexually explicit images and videos.  Without considering the\
    \ person depicted the author, we can still expect any author or distributor to\
    \ be able to demonstrate consent of the depicted.\n\nThe implications of moving\
    \ the philosophical burden there are pretty wide.  Not only would that make publishing\
    \ a video to the internet without consent morally contemptible, but also privately\
    \ sharing these photos without technically \"publishing\" them.  By this logic\
    \ of lacking consent, showing off photos of conquests or just giving other individuals\
    \ a copy is just as morally damned as putting them on the internet, and should\
    \ probably face a similar criminal charge with smaller penalty for doing less\
    \ damage.  This justification should also give plenty of ground to justify the\
    \ depicted stopping circulation of videos or photos of them without having to\
    \ register as copyrighted works and a performer: a demeaning irony of the current\
    \ system.  It would also give the porn industry a way to crack down on free reposting\
    \ of their work (which makes me feel like I need to go into hiding from angry\
    \ free-porn lovers if put into effect).  Still, this would be a much more consistent,\
    \ effective way of handling the criminality of \"revenge porn\" or the broader\
    \ problem of cavalier sharing of sexually explicit images of others in modern\
    \ society.  One much more likely to pass judicial muster as well."

  selftext: "My apologies for the Leibnizian (Leibnizesque?) title, but you'll see\
    \ where I'm going with this.\n\n\nThe \"really awesome critical thinking guide\"\
    \ that made it to 594 (and counting) upvotes began with a flowchart that stated\
    \ what might be called the natural stance. We suppose an objective reality that\
    \ is filtered through our prejudices and perception, and out the other end gets\
    \ spit our reality. In the author's view, critical thinking involves getting as\
    \ clean and efficient a filter as possible, emptying one's self of prejudices\
    \ and beliefs that obscure the view of what is really true. \n\n\nThe number of\
    \ critiques of this view that have occurred in the history of philosophy are too\
    \ numerous to count. Even Thomas Nagel\u2013\u2013a philosopher sympathetic to\
    \ the analytic bent of this sort of \"guide\"\u2013\u2013would condemn this is\
    \ the \"view from nowhere\" that is only one pole of the objective/subjective\
    \ dyad. In other words, this \"guide\" is insufficiently (really, not at all)\
    \ dialectical.\n\n\nNow I wouldn't want to argue that this guide has no purpose\
    \ \u2013 one might make some everyday decisions with this kind of thinking, but\
    \ I wouldn't call it philosophy \u2013 or at least, not good philosophy.\n\n\n\
    I also don't want to turn this into an analytical/continental philosophy bash.\
    \ So perhaps a more useful way to think of this is as systematic/historical divide.\
    \ This \"guide\" is perhaps a rudimentary guide to the logical process; but it\
    \ purports to be transhistorical. If one were to judge figures like Kant or Hegel\
    \ or Sartre or Husserl or Benjamin or (dare I say) Zizek according to this guide,\
    \ they would all fall short. Can you imagine reading Benjamin's *Theses on History*\
    \ using this kind of process?\n\nFor instance, in table two he cautions against\
    \ ambiguity \u2013 this would make Simone de Beauvoir's *Ethics of Ambiguity*\
    \ (in which she argues for the positive aspect of ambiguity) fodder for the fire.\
    \ In table two, he cautions against using testimony as evidence \u2013 this would\
    \ make Paul Ricouer's *Memory, History, Forgetting*, (in which he fixates on testimony\
    \ as historical document) pointless.\n\n\nThe popularity of this guide seems to\
    \ be indicative of the general flavor of this subreddit. It is skewed toward not\
    \ just analytical philosophy, but ahistorical philosophy that is on the cusp of\
    \ what Barnes and Noble might entitle \"How to Think for Dummies.\"\n\n\nNow,\
    \ I've just made an argument about this \"guide\" using evidence hoping that you'll\
    \ share my conclusion. One might say that I've thus demonstrated the guide's efficacy.\
    \ But this post, just like the popular \"guide\" is not really philosophy."

    \ and $420 for both courses. UNO charges $100 per credit hour after the first\
    \ three. Completing a course successfully will earn you 3 academic credits through\
    \ the University of New Orleans. Credits earned through UNO are usually transferrable\
    \ to other universities without a problem.\n\nTo qualify, you must: (1)currently\
    \ be enrolled in a high school or be part of a registered homeschooling program;\
    \ (2)have a minimum cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 or better; AND (3)Have taken\

    \ Martha Nussbaum. \n\nI have published in --the Monist-- and --Basic Income Studies--.\
    \ Here is a link to some of my papers. https://independent.academia.edu/MurfMensch\n\

    \nI administer BIEN's and USBIG's Facebook and Twitter pages and have answered\
    \ questions about Basic Income for journalists a few times. \n\nI draw heavily\
    \ from personal experience. I grew up in a small town in South Arkansas where\
    \ the largest employer was poultry processing and chemical manufacturing. The\
    \ town included some of the wealthiest families in the US but was mostly low-income.\
    \ Many of my friends had family who worked in disturbing and dangerous conditions,\
    \ often for a low wage. \n\nPolitically, I think a BIG will give people more bargaining\
    \ power and will enable people more often and more effectively to find out what\
    \ they believe and what they want with more independence from money and power.\
    \ \n\nRader and Murphy have noted that Basic Income Guarantee discussion get philosophical\
    \ very quickly. We are looking forward to most of your questions. \n\nWe start\
    \ at 12:30.  "

  selftext: "I've seen a number of people these past few months that are just beginning\
    \ to study philosophy. In the upcoming months, some students will begin taking\
    \ introductory classes in college; others are in high school, but are reading\
    \ introductory texts on philosophy on their own. There's even a growing number\
    \ of people outside of high school and college that are sticking their toes in\
    \ the philosophy pool.\n\nRemember: if you're starting out, you might want to\
    \ do some investigating on your own before you ask questions. The resources available\
    \ on the internet are staggering! If I came here for the first time, the first\
    \ place I'd check out would be the sidebar over there ----->\n\n1. There's a recommended\
    \ reading list and posting guidelines. Please abide by them, or your submissions\
    \ will be removed! There's a lot of people that post here for the first time that\
    \ don't read the guidelines. Have you heard about Van Halen's rule about [brown\
    \ M&M's](http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp)? Think of the rules\
    \ on the sidebar as a similar check to see if you're using your noggin!\n\n2.\
    \ I know the search tool on reddit isn't the best, but please check it out! It's\
    \ very likely that your question has been asked before. \n\n3. If you have questions\
    \ that aren't immediately answered by links on the sidebar or searches on reddit,\
    \ then check out [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/)\
    \ or the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/). There's\
    \ a very good chance that a professional philosopher has already written pages\
    \ and pages that answer your question!\n\nIf you don't have any specific questions\
    \ and you just want to learn (who doesn't?), I recommend ...\n\n1. Oxford University's\
    \ **Philosophy for Beginners**, available on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/philosophy-for-beginners/id381704133#ls=1)\
    \ or on [their website](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/podcasts/philosophy_for_beginners).\n\
    \n2. If you're interested in a historical introduction to Ancient Greek and Roman\
    \ philosophy, then check out the podcast by King's College London: **History of\
    \ Philosophy Without Any Gaps**, available on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/history-of-philosophy/id396903391)\
    \ or [their website](http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/).\n\n3. John Searle's\
    \ lectures on iTunes: [Philosophy of Language](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/philosophy-133-001-fall-2010/id391538483),\
    \ [Philosophy of Mind](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/philosophy-132-001-spring/id354819361).\n\
    \n4. The podcast [The Partially Examined Life](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com)\
    \ is worth checking out. So is [Conversations from the Pale Blue Dot](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=1911)\
    \ and [PhilosophyBites](http://www.philosophybites.com/).\n\n-----\n\nIf you have\

  selftext: "An interesting paper by James Hartle: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610131\n\
    \nHe argues that an understanding of fundamental physics can be hindered by the\
    \ \"excess baggage\" of language.\n\nSome of the  main points he makes are:\n\n\
    - Language is best adapted for coarse-grained descriptions of everyday experience.\
    \  When it is applied to fundamental physics, clarity is lost.\n\n- The surest\
    \ route to clarity is to express the constructions of human languages in the language\
    \ of fundamental physical theory, not the other way around.\n\nII. SPACETIME\n\
    \n- There is neither a unique notion of space nor time.  Instead, from each point\
    \ in spacetime, there is a family of timelike directions and 3x as many spacelike\
    \ directions.\n\n- Questions like \"What is happening on Titan now?\" are ambiguous,\
    \ as relativistic effects are not negligible at such distances.\n\n- A way to\
    \ remove ambiguity is to rephrase \"happening\" questions in terms of events:\
    \  \"Is event B in my future light cone at event A?\", \"Is B spacelike separated\
    \ from me at A?\", and \"Is B in my past light cone at A?\"\n\n- Agreement on\
    \ what is happening now can be reached by checking reports of our observations\
    \ against those of others, if \n\na) the relative velocity of others is small\
    \ compared to the speed of light.\n\nb) The time it takes a signal to travel between\
    \ people is small compared to the time it takes to perceive information.\n\nc)\
    \ The reliability of information changes on a timescale much larger than the timescale\
    \ of perceiving infomration.\n\n- For astronauts on Titan communicating with astronauts\
    \ on earth, b) would be violated.\n\n- Quantum gravity introduces further ambiguities.\
    \  Statements like \"A happened in my past light cone.\" become meaningless without\
    \ qualification.\n\nIII. THE QUANTUM MECHANICS OF CLOSED SYSTEMS\n\n- The inputs\
    \ of a quantum mechanical model universe are the initial quantum state |\u03A8\
    >, and an operator H that tells us how |\u03A8> evolves.\n\n- Outputs are probabilities\
    \ of alternative coarse-grained histories.  Each set of alternative coarse-grained\
    \ histories is called a realm.  There is more than one realm, and not all realms\
    \ can be combined into larger realms.  \n\n- There is no non-trivial realm of\
    \ fine-grained histories.\n\n- Quasi-classical realms exhibit the approximate\
    \ regularities of classical physics.\n\n- Quantum theory does not privilege any\
    \ realm.  But observers may employ a realm for its utility.\n\n(Appendix A goes\
    \ into greater detail about graining, histories, and realms)\n\nIV PROBABILITIES\n\
    \n- Probabilities are measures of ignorance in classical physics, but they are\
    \ fundamental in quantum physics.  \n\n- Both probabilities, and conditional probabilities\
    \ can be constructed by observers in the universe. Observers can ask questions\
    \ like \"Given that I observe a tree here today, what is the probability that\
    \ there was a tree here yesterday?\"\n\n- In a probabilistic theory, when we say\
    \ something happened, we mean there is a probability close to unity that it happened.\n\
    \n- Questions, answers, retrodictions, etc. are all in the context of a realm.\n\
    \n- Questions like \"Given that I observe documents dated 55 BC, what is the probability\
    \ that Romans existed in 55 BC?\"  Or \"Given that I observe fossil records, what\
    \ is the probability that dinosaurs existed?\" are all questions in the context\
    \ of a quasiclassical realm.\n\n- Different realms, incompatible with the quasiclassical\
    \ realm, will have different but equally valid descriptions of the past.\n\n-\
    \ E.g. Consider a quantum particle and three boxes A,B, and C.  Given some present\
    \ data, we can ask what the probability is that the particle was in a particular\
    \ box at an earlier time.  In one realm, the answer is \"It was definitely in\
    \ A\".  In another, the answer is \"definitely in B\".\n\n- The usual use of \"\
    happened\" has the context of one realm.  Since QM does not privilege any particular\
    \ realm, \"happened\" must be reformed.  This seems crazy.  When someone asks\
    \ \"What happened yesterday?\" you do not normally respond \"In what realm?\"\n\
    \nV. REALITY\n\n- How do we reconcile the notion of the everyday, physical reality\
    \ of tables chairs and stars with a quantum theory about incompatible realms with\
    \ no privileged realm?\n\n- Our choice of answering questions in the context of\
    \ a classical realm is an artefact of schemata we use.\n\n- Robots or aliens could\
    \ use different schemata for the same reality, and so would employ a different\
    \ realm.\n\nVI. DISPENSABLE WORDS\n\n- Dispensable words can be removed from the\
    \ exposition of a theory without affecting its utility.\n\n- A person will understand\
    \ \"The probability of rain tomorrow.\" and \"The probability of rain to happen\
    \ tomorrow.\" to be the same thing.\n\n- In physics \"happen\" can be confusing\
    \ because it implies \"happen\" is a physical process.\n\n- All histories are\
    \ \"equally real\" if \"real\" is understood in a theoretical framework to mean\
    \ no history is privileged in quantum mechanics, beyond their probabilities.\n\
    \n- Phrases like \"equally real\" should be replaced accordingly.\n\n\n"

  selftext: I did a search on here and didn't see anything posted about this, and
    it's a pretty big deal. Before I continue, [here's the article](http://thelowcountriesblog.onserfdeel.be/post/2011/06/03/Manuscript-of-Spinozae28099s-Ethica-discovered-at-the-Vatican.aspx).
    I actually read a much better article in *The Journal of Philosophy*, but I cannot
    find it online to share it with you all. The article says that the manuscript
    was hidden. To me it is awesome that the Catholic church got their hands on this
    manuscript and actually hid it away from people -- they must have been pretty
    afraid of what he had to say. Also, this manuscript is different than what we've
    all read. For example, and this is pretty big, it only has four parts rather than
    five. Unfortunately, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Vatican-Manuscript-Spinozas-Studies-Intellectual/dp/9004209263)
    is not translated. So, all those who do not read Latin will have to wait until
    sometime this year when the translated version is published. Also, it's rather
    it's bittersweet for those who've dedicated years to studying *The Ethics* as
    we know it.

  selftext: 'As a white, American, upper-middle class college student who faced relatively
    no adversity growing up, my worst enemy is boredom. This has become the greatest
    source of psychological tension in modern life. We are a generation who constantly
    checks Reddit and Facebook and can watch TV with no commercials, and reproduction
    has moved from the top to the bottom of our list of goals as a species. I love
    learning, thinking, and imagining more than anything, and I enjoy attending class,
    but I don''t have the patience to sit down every day and read a fucking book.
    Furthermore, our comfortable lifestyle is born from the suffering of others, who
    don''t have the benefits of education and leisure time to contemplate the universe
    and the self. I have come to understand my identity as an aristocrat, but at same
    time, I feel like a joke.


    I''m currently working on my thesis in the field of Criminal Psychology, which
    fascinates me more than anything, probably because I grew up in a neighborhood
    where crime was virtually nonexistent. I like it because it''s exciting and unknown,
    which seems like a pretty vain reason to me.


    Sure, I''m happy. I often experience moments of transcendence. I believe in morality
    and meaning and the importance of life. But I feel as if I''m on a road to nowhere
    because I don''t have the ability to do anything without questioning, and my questions
    just go deeper and deeper until I have reached oblivion and lethargy, which is
    such a privileged problem to have. I am crippled not by my socioeconomic situation
    or physical limits, but by curiosity, which is unheard of to most of the world.


    I''ve made an appointment with a shrink to help me sort out my thoughts (another
    privilege most people don''t get), but I wanted to see if Reddit can help. Who
    else feels these things, and who has overcome this problem?



    EDIT: Thanks for your suggestions. But I want to bring to light one of my inherent
    problems: I have a really short attention span, and I don''t have the capacity
    to work on anything for very long. I read a lot, but I''m a slow reader and usually
    space out for long, LONG periods of time whenever I read anything mentally stimulating,
    going deep in thought about particular parts of the text, sometimes one sentence
    after the other. I guess this is more of a cognitive issue than an emotional one,
    so if anyone can help with that, I would appreciate.


    EDIT: Thanks for all the AWESOME responses. Sincerely. I''m reminded why I became
    this way and feel

    much less alone. I''m going to try as many of your suggestions as possible. Good
    luck to everyone else on their journey to self-actualization and thanks for the
    help!'

  selftext: "I was reading [this article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/big-brain-gene-allowed-for-evolutionary-expansion-of-human-neocortex/)\n\
    \n> Then the team inserted and expressed (turned on) this DNA snippet in the brains\
    \ of mice. Though mice normally have a tiny, smooth neocortex, the mice with the\
    \ gene insertion grew what looked like larger neocortices; these amped-up brain\
    \ regions contained loads of neurons and some even began forming the characteristic\
    \ folds, or convolutions, found in the human brain, a geometry that packs a lot\
    \ of dense brain tissue into a small amount of space. (The researchers did not\
    \ check to see if the mice actually got smarter, though that is a potential avenue\
    \ of future research, Florio said).\n\nI remember reading a post on /r/philosophy\
    \ about the [ethics of eating self aware animals](http://philosophyonthemesa.com/tag/rooks-crows-magpies-pigs-mirror-self-recognition-test-sense-of-self/)\
    \ and treatment in general\n\n> But what lies in the future of animal research?\
    \ I predict before long, we will hear that pigs can recognize themselves in the\
    \ mirror. Pigs are smart, we know that\u2014it is not too far-fetched to assume\
    \ that they also have a sense of self, and maybe even a theory of mind (understanding\
    \ that other members of their species are aware). They are in some ways smarter\
    \ than ordinary chimps, and chimps have a theory of mind. So is that the end of\
    \ bacon as we know it? You know what? I would actually say yes. If we can justify\
    \ killing and eating a self-aware animal, there is no theoretical boundary preventing\
    \ us from killing and eating humans, other than speciecism. An Asian prince of\
    \ long, long ago who used to eat slave girls was told that eating humans was wrong.\
    \ He answered, \u201CBut they taste good!\u201D So we can\u2019t use the same\
    \ argument for eating pork\u2014that it tastes good. So far few people eat crows\
    \ (except metaphorically), but the day will come when some of our food animals\
    \ will be proven to be self-aware, at some basic level. And in any event, all\
    \ of them have a general awareness of pain and pleasure (like Bentham pointed\
    \ out\u2014\u201Cnot Can they speak, nor Can they reason, but Can they suffer?).\
    \ Bentham didn\u2019t have a problem eating meat, because he viewed the pros and\
    \ the cons of incurring suffering\u2014but can we afford to be as bombastic and\
    \ calculating?  Some (like PETA people) would say that the difference between\
    \ self-awareness and general awareness is invented by humans with an agenda toward\
    \ eating meat, because life is life (a pig is a boy etc.). In my own view, self-awareness\
    \ does mark a different kind of existence than general awareness. I will eat animals\
    \ who are aware of their surroundings, but not animals who are aware that they\
    \ are aware. The day when our meat animals turn out to be self-aware, even in\
    \ the slightest degree, that\u2019s probably it for my meat-eating days. Unless\
    \ I am locked in mortal combat with a pig, and manage to kill it with my equivalent\
    \ of its tusks (my Swiss Army knife). Then I\u2019ll proudly eat it, and wear\
    \ its skin\u2026\n\nI would love to see more intelligent creatures. But what worries\
    \ me. Is this type of work is being done and I have no idea if researchers consider\
    \ the ethics. \n\nWhen dolly the sheep was being cloned the president stepped\

  selftext: "Woody Allen (in Annie Hall):\n> \"If one guy is starving someplace, it\
    \ puts a cramp in my evening\"\n\nI like this quote because it is a fairly subtle\
    \ jab at our conceptions of Happiness and Empathy. Can a person truly experience\
    \ happiness without ignorance and apathy?\n\nMy position is clear. A learned person\
    \ with empathy simply cannot be happy, no matter which perfect state of 'heaven'\
    \ you put them in, as long as there exists a 'hell' in the peripheries. \n\n>\
    \ Is there such a thing as Heaven with perfect knowledge of Hell?\n\n* If empathy\
    \ means you cannot enjoy dinner with a starving child staring at you near the\
    \ dinner table, yet dinner resumes normally if said starving child existed behind\
    \ the wall. It seems that the only variable for empathy here is conscious proximity.\
    \ \n\nTherefor, Ignorance is an important requisite for Happiness.\n\n* One can\
    \ still enjoy their dinner with a starving child staring at them if that person\
    \ is apathetic.\n\nTherefor, Apathy is the alternative requisite for Happiness\
    \ if Ignorance is not met.\n\n* In this world there is both mass-scaled suffering\
    \ AND widely available information on said suffering.\n\nTherefor, the act of\
    \ Ignorance is not even accidental (such as not knowing such a starving child\
    \ even existed), but purposeful. I argue it takes a serious act of self-deception\
    \ (purposefully obscuring the knowledge you have to reduce conscious load) in\
    \ order to enjoy one's time.\n\nSince people claim to be happy all the time, I\
    \ can conclude 1 of these 3 contingencies:\n\n1. Either, empathy as we describe\
    \ it is an illusion for some other purpose (social pressures to feel bad for something\
    \ described as bad?).\n\n2. Or, self-deception is a consistent component of our\
    \ experiential lives. \n\n3. Or, Happiness as we describe it is an illusion\n\n\

  selftext: "Many of us have some idea of what the problem of evil is. There\u2019\
    s something fishy about all the bad things that happen in the world if there\u2019\
    s supposed to be a God watching over us. My aim here will be to explore two ways\
    \ of turning this hunch into a more sophisticated argument against the existence\
    \ of God. One that is more straightforward, but much harder for the atheist to\
    \ defend, and slightly less powerful version that is hard to deny.\n\n**The Concept\
    \ of God**\n\nHistorically the problem of evil (PoE) has been formulated as something\
    \ like this:\n\n(L1) If God exists, then it is all-powerful, all-knowing, and\
    \ morally perfect.\n\n(L2) Thus, supposing that God exists, God would have the\
    \ power to put an end to any evil that should appear.\n\n(L3) \u201C \u201C God\
    \ would know of any evil if there were any.\n\n(L4) \u201C \u201C God would have\
    \ the desire to stop any evil that should appear.\n\n(L5) Thus if God exists,\
    \ then there should be no evil.\n\n(L6) Evil does exist.\n\n(L7) So God does not\
    \ exist.\n\nAs we\u2019ll see in a moment, this is not the best way to formulate\
    \ the PoE. However, in examining this formulation we can see the intuitive notions\
    \ that drive the PoE and secure a few concepts that will later apply to the better\
    \ formulation.\n\nL1 obviously plays a vital role in the argument, but why should\
    \ we believe it? Why should the concept of God pick out something that is all-powerful,\
    \ all-knowing, and morally perfect? Well, for a start, it\u2019s worth noting\
    \ that the argument does not need the qualities in their omni sense in order to\
    \ work out just as well. Indeed, in order for the inconsistency between evil and\
    \ God to appear, God only needs be very powerful, very knowledgable, and very\
    \ good. For the sake of brevity I\u2019ll be abbreviating these qualities as \u201C\
    omni-such and such,\u201D but just be aware that the argument works either way.\n\
    \nBut why think that God has these qualities at all? Either perfectly or in great\
    \ amounts. Consider the role that God plays as an object of worship many of the\
    \ world\u2019s religions: that of satisfying some desires that tug at the hardship\
    \ of human existence. Desires such as that the world be a place in which justice\
    \ ultimately prevails and evildoers get what\u2019s coming to them, that the world\
    \ be a place in which our lives have meaning and purpose, and that our mortal\
    \ lives not be the limits of our existence. In order to satisfy these desires\
    \ God would have to be at the very least quite powerful, quite knowledgeable,\
    \ and very good. Insofar as God does not provide an answer to these problems,\
    \ God isn\u2019t obviously a being worthy of worship. A weak God would not be\
    \ a great being deserving of worship (and likely could not have created the universe\
    \ in the first place), a stupid God would be pitiable, and a cruel God would be\
    \ a tyrant, not worthy of respect or worship at all.\n\nIn this sense the concept\
    \ of God that\u2019s being deployed applies well to common religious beliefs.\
    \ So if the problem of evil succeeds, it\u2019s a powerful argument against those\
    \ believers. However, the problem also applies very well to a more philosophical\
    \ notion of God. For instance, some philosophers have argued that the concept\
    \ of God or the very existence of our universe necessitates that there actually\
    \ exist a being that is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. So the argument,\
    \ if it succeeds, also delivers a powerful argument against the philosopher\u2019\
    s God.\n\nThe question now remains: can the argument succeed?\n\n**How to Formulate\
    \ the Argument**\n\nI mentioned earlier that the \u2018L\u2019 version of the\
    \ PoE is not the best one. The reason for this is that it tries to go too far;\
    \ the \u2018L\u2019 argument\u2019s aim is to establish that the existence of\
    \ *any* evil is incompatible with the existence of God. In order for this claim\
    \ to be established, premise L5 must be true. However, L5 is difficult to motivate\
    \ if not obviously false. For example, there may be instances in which a good\
    \ person allows some harm to come about for reasons that are still morally good.\
    \ A common example might be allowing a child to come to small harm (e.g.falling\
    \ down on their bike) in order to bring about a greater good (like learning to\
    \ ride a bike well and without error). So it\u2019s at least logically possible\
    \ for God to be morally perfect by allowing us to suffer some harms in order to\
    \ bring about greater goods. Some theologians, for example, have suggested that\
    \ the existence of free will is so good a thing that it\u2019s better we should\
    \ have free will even if that means that some people will be able to harm others.\n\
    \nIt\u2019s possible that there might be a successful defense of the \u2018L\u2019\
    \ formulation, but such a defense would require a defense of the problematic L5.\
    \ For that reason it might be wise for the atheist to seek greener pastures. And\
    \ greener pastures there are! Recently philosophers have advanced so-called \u201C\
    evidential\u201D versions of the PoE. In contrast with the \u2018L\u2019 formulation,\
    \ such arguments aim to establish that there are *some* evils the existence of\
    \ which provides evidence against a belief in God. Thus the argument abandons\
    \ the problematic L5 for more modest (and more easily defensible) premises. Let\u2019\
    s consider a version of this kind of argument below:\n\n(E1) There are some events\
    \ in the world such that a morally good agent in a position to prevent them would\
    \ have moral reason(s) to prevent them and would not have any overriding moral\
    \ reasons to allow them.\n\n(E2) For any act that constitutes allowing these events\
    \ when one is able to prevent them, the total moral reasons against doing this\
    \ act outweigh the total moral reasons for doing it.\n\n(E3) For an act to be\
    \ morally wrong just is for the total moral reasons against doing it to outweigh\
    \ to total moral reasons for doing it.\n\n(E4) Thus the acts described in E2 are\
    \ morally wrong.\n\n(E5) An omniscient and omnipotent being could refrain from\
    \ doing the acts described in E2.\n\n(E6) Thus if there is an omniscient and omnipotent\
    \ being, that being performs some acts that are morally wrong.\n\n(E7) But a being\
    \ that performs some morally wrong acts is not morally perfect.\n\n(E8) Thus if\
    \ there is an omniscient and omnipotent being, that being is not morally perfect.\n\
    \n(E9 The definition of God just is a being that is omniscient, omnipotent, and\
    \ morally perfect.\n\n(E10) Thus God does not exist.\n\n**Defending the Argument**\n\
    \nE1 involves both empirical and moral claims. The moral claims are that there\
    \ are certain things that, if they happened, would give capable agents more reasons-against\
    \ than reasons-for doing them. It\u2019s very plausible that there are such things.\
    \ For example, if children were kidnapped and sold as slaves, it would be wrong\
    \ for a capable agent to allow that. If a person contracted cancer through no\
    \ fault of their own, it would be wrong for a capable agent to allow them to suffer\
    \ it. If some teenagers were lighting a cat on fire, it would be wrong for a capable\
    \ agent to allow them to continue. I could go on, but you get the point.\n\nThe\
    \ empirical claim in E1 is that there are events of the sort described above.\
    \ This should be uncontroversial. There is child slavery, there are people who\
    \ suffer from cancer (and other diseases) through no fault of their own, and there\
    \ are people who are cruel to animals. Thus E1 is overall highly plausible.\n\n\
    The sorts of acts described in E2 just are acts the performance of which allows\
    \ for the sorts of events in E1 to occur. This could be anything from standing\
    \ next to a cancer patient\u2019s bed with a cure in hand while not delivering\
    \ it all the way to setting a forest on fire before evacuating it, causing many\
    \ animals to burn and suffer. What\u2019s more, an omniscient and omnipotent being\
    \ could refrain from performing these sorts of acts. Such a being could choose\
    \ instead to intervene when children are being kidnapped, to cure the innocent\
    \ of cancer, or to save animals from burning to death, but instead it chooses\
    \ to sit by (E5). The rest of the premises are all logically entailed within the\
    \ argument, with the exception of E9 which was defended earlier, so the argument\
    \ seems initially sound.\n\nOne might rehash the objection to the \u2018L\u2019\
    \ formulation at this point. That is, one might argue that there are reasons which\
    \ we don\u2019t know of that would give a morally good and capable agent overriding\
    \ reason to allow things like child slavery, cancer, and animal combustion. There\
    \ are two things one might say in response to this:\n\n(A) One could point out\
    \ that whether or not there are such unknown reasons, we are justified in believing\
    \ that the relevant acts of allowance are wrong. After all, all of the reasons\
    \ that we currently know of suggest that there are the acts in question are wrong.\
    \ Thus the claim that the acts described in E2 are wrong is justified by induction,\
    \ just as the claim that all swans are white might be justified if one has encountered\
    \ many many swans and they have all been white.\n\n(B) More recently it has been\
    \ suggested that denying the wrongness of these sorts of acts leads one to complete\
    \ moral skepticism. I won\u2019t go that far here, but there is a similar line\
    \ of response that I will deploy. Namely, if the theist wants to say that it actually\
    \ would be morally *right* to allow slavers to kidnap children, for example, then\
    \ they are denying many (if not all) of our commonsense moral judgments. Not only\
    \ this, but they are denying many commonsense moral judgments that hold up to\
    \ a test under reflective equilibrium. (For comparison, the belief that allowing\
    \ child slavery is wrong might hold up to rational reflection in the way that\
    \ the belief that homosexual activity is wrong would not.) Perhaps this sort of\
    \ denial is available to the theist; perhaps she can say that the vast majority\
    \ of our seemingly rational moral beliefs are wrong, but taking this approach\
    \ requires both (1) that the theist can offer an alternative means of moral knowledge\
    \ that aligns with her beliefs and (2) that the positive case for theism be so\
    \ overwhelming that it casts doubt on such seemingly obvious claims as \u201C\
    allowing child slavery would be wrong.\u201D\n\nRegardless of the success of (1),\
    \ it seems to me that we have good reason to doubt that (2) can succeed. The positive\
    \ case for theism is, at least in philosophy, famously weak. So at least until\
    \ the theist can produce a compelling argument for her position, the problem of\
    \ evil gives us a powerful argument against it."

  selftext: "I recently read German philosopher Thomas Metzinger's 'The Ego Tunnel'\
    \ which discusses consciousness and the lack of existence of the self. His theory\
    \ has significant implications for free will, as he states: \n> From a scientific,\
    \ third-person perspective, our inner experience of strong autonomy may look increasingly\
    \ like what it has been all along: an appearance only.\n\nI just wanted to run\
    \ my understanding of his theory and its implications by you guys to see if I'm\
    \ following the right lines. Metzinger believes that what you are in essence is\
    \ not a 'self', but rather a self-modelling organism. 'Self' in this regard refers\
    \ to our intuitive experience of ourselves as autonomous agents. The self is the\
    \ real deep down 'you' that is the same throughout the course of your life. It\
    \ is the self that people refer to when they talk about '*having* a body' rather\
    \ than '*being* a body'. The self is that agent which *possesses* the body. \n\
    \nIn the naturalistic worldview, there is no special 'self' which owns your body,\
    \ you are just the sum of your physical body and its associated mental functions.\
    \ For Metzinger, this feeling of owning a body and being a self is the product\
    \ of a neurocomputation going in the brain called a 'self-model'. Anything that\
    \ falls within the self-model, we have a sense of ownership over and this is the\
    \ basis of our mistaken belief in free-will. \n\nMetzinger supports his theory\
    \ with examples of when the model breaks down. For example, the boundaries of\
    \ the 'self-model' can move around and even partially retreat from the boundaries\
    \ of our physical body as in 'alien hand syndrome' in which the patient feels\
    \ they do not own or control one of their arms. It can retreat from the entirety\
    \ of our physical body altogether in conditions such as depersonalisation disorder\
    \ in which the patient feels no ownership or control of their entire body. Or\
    \ it can expand far beyond the boundaries of our body (forget the name of this\
    \ condition) Metzinger describes patients who feel as if they control the course\
    \ of the sun through the sky or the traffic outside. \n\nWhat these examples indicate\
    \ is that we have a sense of ownership and agency for processes which fall within\
    \ the boundaries of our 'self-model', including the firing neurons sparking the\
    \ causal links which give rise to our behaviours. We feel as if we caused these\
    \ actions 'out of the blue' as independent originators. But we are not separate\
    \ from the physical universe. Give it a 'self-model' and the moon would feel as\
    \ though it choses to orbit the earth.  \n\nIt's strange that fee-will debates\
    \ rarely ever discuss the existence of the 'self', as it seems this is a fundamental\
    \ aspect of the debate. With no 'self' there isn't even an agent which *could*\
    \ conceivably exercise free-will.  "

  selftext: 'I''m an indie game designer, and I''ve been thinking a lot about the
    ethics of my craft recently. It''s been a surprisingly hot topic ever since the
    boom of social games and microtransactions a few years ago. After I started getting
    increasingly out of my depth and stumbling around the Stanford Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy, I figured I might get some more direct help here.


    Specifically, I''ve been thinking about stuff like slot machines or other shallow,
    addictive games. They feel really icky to me, but I''m not entirely sure why.
    It''s not just because they make money. After all, if players get some pleasure
    out of it, isn''t that worth some cost? Yet, even if we were to make our (addictive,
    totally shallow) game completely free, I''d still feel bad about people sinking
    time into it. It seems to me like the game exists to rope people in and waste
    their time, but again, if the players enjoy it, what''s wrong?


    1. So let''s refine this thought experiment a bit more, and put it into more familiar
    territory: If I were to invent a machine or a drug that would zonk you out and
    give you some sort of mild empty pleasure for as long as you want at no cost (other
    than the time), is it a good invention?


    2. What if the machine were mildly addictive (enough to make people put in more
    time than they''d normally want, but not so much it ruins their lives)?


    3. Maybe part of what bothers me about this machine is that it is not providing
    pleasure in a constructive way. A lot of the time, we get pleasure from accomplishment
    or food or some other presumably beneficial cause. When the pleasure doesn''t
    align with true benefit (like, say, unsafe sex or sugary food or a dangerous drug),
    we consider that a bad quality. But if the pleasure is not actively harming us
    (i.e. neutral other than time cost), is it still wrong just because it isn''t
    actively helping? Is there a bright line to draw here?


    I don''t know. Please help?'

  selftext: '**''A Clockwork Orange'' has always been one of my favourite books, however,
    like a lot of the book''s readers I take umbrage with the final chapter.**


    **For those unfamiliar with the book, I shall go over the narrative so you can
    fully understand my issue with the novella''s closing pages. If you''ve already
    read the book, scroll down.**


    The novella is split into three distinct parts.


    Part I is about the illegal exploits of a gang lead by the book''s main character
    ''Alex''. The actions they perform include theft, property damage, assault, rape
    (including the rape of two pre-adolescent girls) and eventually (in the closing
    sequence of this part) murder. Resulting in the murder is the arrest of Alex and
    the revelation that Alex - a murdering, rapist - is fifteen years old.


    Part II. Alex is now in jail. Numerous violent incidents occur between him and
    a cellmate, thus revealing that not only is unremorseful of his previous actions
    but that he''s happy to re-enact them onto other individuals. Eventually he is
    moved to a different cell and becomes very close to the priest in the jail, not
    due to serious religious belief but because he enjoys reading the violent passages
    in the bible. Rumour spreads around the jail that there is a way to get out of
    a sentence quickly and released back into the world, so long as you go under a
    treatment known as the ''Ludovico technique''. Alex signs up for the Ludovico
    treatment. The treatment ensures that Alex physically cannot perform or even think
    about acts of violence (no matter how small), because by doing so he feels physically
    sick, he gags and feels nauseated. There is a particularly interesting sentence
    which reveals that these feelings kick in when Alex contemplates harming a fly.
    In other words, Alex does not choose to do good, but by proxy he is made to do
    good by forcibly being repelled to do bad (baring in mind that the novella deals
    with a binary and stereotypical ideas of good and evil). Deep down Alex wants
    to rape, murder and torture but due to the state''s psychological treatment forced
    onto him, he cannot. The treatment eventually ends and Alex is "cured" of the
    "criminal instinct". A minor note in this part which later on becomes important
    is that Alex also feels physically ill when listening to music as before, in Part
    I, listening to music - especially beethoven''s 9th - would stimulate in his mind
    images of rape and violence.


    Part III. Now released into the real world, Alex bumps into the people he met
    before, including several of his victims who take their revenge on him, he even
    bumps into members of his old criminal gang who are now revealed (in satirical
    fashion) to be policemen. But of course, Alex cannot defend himself, as thinking
    about committing violence makes him feel physically sick. After being beaten up
    by his old - now policemen - friends, Alex goes off into the night and discovers
    a house, he knocks on the door begging for help. Of course, because of the novels
    symmetrical structure (he meets the victims which he met in Part 1 in Part 3),
    Alex bumps into one of the victims of his most violent escapade: the writer who
    was beaten up and made to watch his wife being raped (who eventually died due
    to it). The husband does not recognise Alex because during the rape, Alex and
    his gang were wearing masks. The husband is a political activist who is against
    the government''s ludovico treatment due to his strong libertarian convictions.
    Eventually, the husband discovers who Alex is, locks Alex in a room and then plays
    beethoven for minutes on end for the purpose of revenge (Alex thus then feels
    physically sick). Due to the nausea and intense pain Alex goes through, Alex then
    ATTEMPTS suicide, and fails. The suicide attempt is then all over the papers and
    is presented through the idea that the government''s programme lead to Alex killing
    himself. Alex is then sent to hospital and the treatment is reversed: in other
    words, he no longer feels sick when thinking about rape, theft, murder or making
    anybody else suffer. He now has the freedom to perform such actions


    **Then we come to the final chapter. The final chapter reveals that Alex has now
    chosen to be good and has chosen to never commit such evil acts which he did during
    his younger years. In other words, the final chapter answers the question which
    it poses throughout: "Is it ethically correct to remove the freedom to commit
    evil acts in the hope that society is made a safer place?"/"Should goodness be
    imposed onto somebody or should goodness be chosen?"**


    **I find the final chapter problematic for many reasons but the main one is the
    artistic quality of the novella: to me it is more interesting if the novella poses
    a morally-complex question than answers it or provides a digestible message. It''s
    more intellectually troubling - throughout, the novel poses so many interesting
    questions (Authoritarianism vs Libertarianism perhaps the largest one - specifically
    in how to deal with crime) and it seems to be a cop-out to not only answer it,
    but answer the questions in a blunt and unsubtle manner.**


    **Essentially I have two questions:**


    **(1) What are your thoughts on the final chapter? Do you find it convincing?
    Do you find the ''answer'' ethically suspect or ethically correct, or neither?**


    **(2) Presuming that the final chapter is removed and the novella is left with
    the ethically complex cliffhanger of Alex now being able to choose between good
    and evil, what are your opinions in regards to the main question of the novel:**


    **Should the state strip an individual of their own freedom to choose evil in
    order to make them good? Or should the choice of whether to be good be up to the
    individual and never the state?**



    EDIT: Alex did not commit suicide then wake up from the dead! This was a typo
    on my behalf, to which I have now edited...Alex ATTEMPTS SUICIDE by jumping out
    of a window, it fails.'

  selftext: 'Here is a more brief summary from the wiki:


    "Here is a rudimentary, overall, "big picture" impression of Chris Langan''s Cognitive-Theoretic
    Model of the Universe (CTMU).


    Matter can be reduced to atoms, atoms can be reduced to subatomic particles, etc,
    etc. Eventually, if we keep reducing in this matter, we get to the most fundamental
    constituents of reality: information. The universe can be conceived as a vast
    arrangement of information: ones and zeros and the mathematical relationships
    between them. Since this is basically analogous to "content" and "grammar," the
    universe is thus conceived as a language. The thing about this particular language
    is that it is so tautological that it contains all of the conditions necessary
    for its own existence. The mere possibility of this language is enough to ensure
    that it generates itself. It is sort of like a self-executing algorithm that generates
    the mind in which the algorithm itself is known.


    Although this mind (God''s mind) sits in knowledge of itself in an unchanging,
    eternal way, it contains within it all of the processes required for it to refine
    itself into existence out of nothingness. As such, consciousness is stratified:
    the bottom stratum is the all-knowing mind of God, and within this all-knowing
    mind of God is contained all of the more superficial strata of consciousness that
    are inherent in the creation process. In other words, God is aware of all the
    steps in its own creation. However, from the vantage point of these more superficial
    strata, the universe appears as a physical entity unfolding in physical space.
    Our human minds are pieces of these more superficial strata. To us, things look
    like they are still unfolding.


    And recall that our conscious minds are contained within God''s consciousness.
    As such, we retain the creative power of God on a scale that is localized in time
    and space. We can choose to act in a way that facilitates the execution of the
    self-creating algorithm that creates God, or we can choose to act in a way that
    is not useful to this end, which is known as the "telos" of this particular reality.
    If we choose to act in a way that is in line with the telos, those parts of our
    minds that match the mind of God get preserved and we basically move closer to
    the all-knowing substratum, or the consciousness of God. If we act against the
    telos, what happens may be that those elements of our minds that do not match
    the mind of God get recycled endlessly or something until they properly refine
    themselves. The eternal unchanging nature of the overall God consciousness is
    preserved despite our free choices because the system continually adjusts itself
    in such a way that even though it is changing internally it remains eternal overall.


    In short, reality itself is a self-refining linguistic system which, due to its
    form, cannot NOT exist. Even if there is nothingness, this system will exist and
    know itself and all of the localized conscious minds within its creation process
    will experience its informational structure as real, physical, etc. It is thus
    self-creating, as it requires nothing outside of itself to exist."


    Edit: Langan''s intro to the theory which I originally intended to link can be
    found [here](http://www.ctmu.org). '

  selftext: "Hedonism is the view that pleasure is what is fundamentally valuable\
    \ and all other things that we take to be valuable can be reduced to their element\
    \ of pleasure. In this post I\u2019ll try to lay out some reasons why we might\
    \ accept hedonism and show how the view fails to live up to the hype, so to speak,\
    \ given by its initial plausibility.\n\n**What motivates hedonism?**\n\nI think\
    \ it\u2019s quite common for those of us just beginning to think about the tough\
    \ questions in value theory to feel a strong pull from hedonism. After all, it\
    \ has quite a lot of intuitive pull when we begin to consider what things are\
    \ valuable and why they are so. It doesn\u2019t take much reflection identify\
    \ pleasure as a strong candidate for the fundamental source of value in our lives.\
    \ Just think about some things that you find to be valuable: [tuna](http://www.streetfoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Kuromon-Tuna-Sashimi-1024x768.jpg),\
    \ [red pandas](http://news.worldwild.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/red_panda.jpg),\
    \ [red pandas eating tuna](http://i.imgur.com/0B3dbH6.gif), and [all of the scenes\
    \ from *Captain America* with Agent Carter in them](http://i.imgur.com/2Ey2dq6.jpg).\
    \ All of these things and more seem to have something in common: they give me\
    \ pleasure of one sort or another. So one immediate advantage for hedonism is\
    \ that it\u2019s so easy to find examples of things that are valuable and are\
    \ also pleasurable. What a happy coincidence!\n\nAnother advantage for this view\
    \ as we start to consider the value question in more depth is that it reduces\
    \ everything we value into one bite-sized concept: pleasure. This means that there\u2019\
    s no long-winded procedure required to know whether or not something is valuable.\
    \ We need only ask ourselves: is it pleasurable? And be on our way. This theoretical\
    \ economy also makes the view seem less ad hoc than theories that might try to\
    \ construe value in terms of many unrelated things.\n\nFinally, hedonism appears\
    \ to be a strong theory when it historically hasn\u2019t had many serious competitors.\
    \ Hedonism has enjoyed a lineage going all the way back to Ancient Greece and\
    \ has been represented throughout the modern era and in contemporary philosophy.\
    \ Few other theories can showcase such a history of supporters. Especially more\
    \ recently popular views.\n\n**What\u2019s wrong with hedonism?**\n\nThe first\
    \ point I presented in favor of hedonism was the ease of examples connecting pleasure\
    \ and value. However, as we dip into the issue a little further, we run across\
    \ some counterexamples to the thesis. Perhaps one of the most powerful thought\
    \ experiments to run against hedonism is to imagine a machine that makes us feel\
    \ pure pleasure all the time. (Note: this is not Nozick\u2019s experience machine,\
    \ although this example appears in the same chapter.) Suppose that I find myself\
    \ in possession of such a machine and I bring it to you asking if you\u2019d like\
    \ to plug in. However, I warn you that once you plug in, you\u2019re plugged in\
    \ for the rest of your life, which will be the same length that it would have\
    \ been if you hadn\u2019t plugged in. Not to worry, though! Since pleasure is\
    \ what\u2019s actually valuable in life (as hedonism tell us) it\u2019s obvious\
    \ that the best thing you can do for yourself is to plug in. And don\u2019t worry\
    \ about your family and friends. After all, your love for them is only worth anything\
    \ because of the pleasure it involves and we\u2019ll be replacing that with more\
    \ pleasure! Of course, I have plenty of these machines back in my garage, so as\
    \ soon as we get you hooked up, I\u2019ll hook them up too.\n\nNow I don\u2019\
    t think I\u2019m stretching the imagination here when I say that most of us would\
    \ probably rather not plug into this machine. What\u2019s more, I think that this\
    \ judgment will hold up under rational reflection. But surely it\u2019s rational\
    \ to do what\u2019s best for you (assuming it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone else).\
    \ What, then, can explain our rational rejection of a lifetime in the pleasure\
    \ machine? The most obvious way to go here is just to ditch hedonism altogether\
    \ and go for another theory, but hold on. Why can\u2019t the hedonist just say\
    \ that we\u2019re mistaken about the pleasure machine and that we should all plug\
    \ in immediately? Recall that our initial justification for believing hedonism\
    \ was our judgments about which things were valuable: tuna, red pandas, and so\
    \ on. But what\u2019s at play here is also our judgment about what\u2019s valuable:\
    \ life outside of the pleasure machine. If the hedonist wants to bite this bullet,\
    \ then she finds herself in the awkward position of accepting all and only judgments\
    \ that support her view in spite of the fact that there are other value judgments\
    \ to consider.\n\nStill, perhaps the hedonist can wiggle her way out of this one.\
    \ She might point out that our lives are filled with a rich variety of pleasures\
    \ and that a machine that delivers a steady stream of just one sort of pleasure\
    \ is not actually as good as going for the full experience. You wouldn\u2019t\
    \ *just* eat tuna all the time; the best sashimi mixes in good tuna with good\
    \ salmon, yellowtail, and other fish. As well, if you feel the same sort of pleasure\
    \ thinking about red pandas as you do thinking about Agent Carter, then you\u2019\
    re just weird.\n\nThis way out is all well and good for the hedonist, but it shoots\
    \ the view\u2019s second plausibility point right in the foot. Hedonism seems\
    \ like a great theory because we\u2019re reducing all of these things we value\
    \ into one thing: pleasure. But if there\u2019s an incredible variety of pleasures\
    \ and there\u2019s no clear relationship between them or even clear rules about\
    \ how each one works internally (i.e. what\u2019s the correct balance of tuna\
    \ and salmon for the most pleasurable sushi meal), hedonism doesn\u2019t seem\
    \ to buy us much in the way of theoretical economy. We might also worry that this\
    \ view fails to be hedonism at all, depending on how critical it is to the theory\
    \ that pleasure be one unique thing.\n\nFinally, I showed that hedonism seems\
    \ to have a promising theoretical lineage compared to its competitors. However,\
    \ if the other problems that I\u2019ve illuminated for the theory are truly problems,\
    \ then a history of support is not enough to overturn that. As well, [modern day\
    \ competitors such as pluralism or desire-satisfaction theories](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1zf6sj/weekly_discussion_what_makes_ones_life_go_better/)\
    \ seem to stack up pretty well against hedonism when measured by the issues that\
    \ I\u2019ve talked about here."

    \ be able \n>to  recognize  and  make  known  in  Western languages  the counterpart\
    \ to \n>their  own  discipline. \n\n\nSome examples I'd like to mention:\n\nRegarding\
    \ logic, the Nyaya sutras (2nd century BCE) laid out an epistemological framework\
    \ defining what knowledge is and how we can obtain it, rules for inference, types\
    \ of and rules for debate. The Nyaya tradition was a realist school, and they\
    \ flourished alongside the other schools of thought until the 13th century when\
    \ a new version \"Navya Nyaya\" was created to answer certain objections.\n\n\
    The debates between Nyaya and others developed logic in India over the years\n\
    \nThis school was particularly rigorous and they came up with concepts that resembled\
    \ Frege's theory of logic.\n\nAccording to K.K. Chakrobarty:\n\n\n>In the third\
    \ part we have shown how the study of the so-called 'restrictive conditions for\
    \ universals' in Navya-Nyaya logic anticipated some of the developments of modern\
    \ set theory. [...] In this section the discussion will center around some of\
    \ the 'restrictive conditions for universals (jatibadhaka) proposed by Udayana.\
    \ [...] Another restrictive condition is anavastha or vicious infinite regress.\
    \ According to this restrictive condition, no universal (jati) can be admitted\
    \ to exist, the admission of which would lead to a vicious infinite regress. As\
    \ an example Udayana says that there can be no universal of which every universal\
    \ is a member; for if we had any such universal, then, by hypothesis, we have\
    \ got a given totality of all universals that exist and all of them belong to\
    \ this big universal. But this universal is itself a universal and hence (since\
    \ it cannot be a member of itself, because in Udayana's view no universal can\
    \ be a member of itself) this universal too along with other universals must belong\
    \ to a bigger universal and so on ad infinitum. What Udayana says here has interesting\
    \ analogues in modern set theory in which it is held that a set of all sets (i.e.,\
    \ a set to which every set belongs) does not exist.\n\n\nIt might be interesting\
    \ to mention that this upgrade came about due to the criticisms of a skeptic known\
    \ as Sriharsa, who posed the Gettier problems at around 1150 AD, over 800 years\
    \ before Gettier.\n\nWhile on the topic of skeptics, the two other famous skeptics\
    \ are the founder of Mahayana, Nagarjuna, and the skeptic Jayarasi Bhatta.\n\n\
    Nagarjuna lived in the first century AD and is famous for his ideas of sunyata\
    \ or emptiness, and for showing that all truths and concepts are co-dependent\
    \ and thus we can never find an unchanging essence of anything, thus showing the\
    \ impossibility of any ultimate truth.\n\nHis work was continued by other famous\
    \ logicians such as Dharmakirti and Chandrakirti; as well as  Bhavaviveka, who\
    \ formulated Nagarjuna's writings into a formal syllogistic manner.\n\nJayarashi\
    \ Bhatta lived presumably around 800 AD, and in his work Tattvapaplavasimha, he\
    \ shows, by a method of reductio arguments that all philosophical activity trying\
    \ to arrive at true knowledge is useless. \n\n\nThere is also the famous Advaita\
    \ Vedanta school, which is a monistic school which took sort of an anti realist\
    \ position which was similar to the Madhyamaka Buddhists. I won't go into detail\
    \ here.\n\nApart from them there are also other schools such as\n\nSankhya (metaphysical\
    \ dualist)\n\nYoga (a type of dualist)\n\nVaisheshika (Atomist school)\n\nMimansa\
    \ (realist exegetical school)\n\nOther Buddhist schools like Pudgalavada and Adhidharma\n\
    \nThere are also the Jains, who are relativists with regard to truth, and made\
    \ many important contributions to Indian logic.\n\n\nIn the end, I hope this post\
    \ arouses some curiosity in the members and I hope that they think about why it\
    \ is unfair that by p[philosophy we unhelpfully refer to Western Philosophy as\
    \ the default.\n\nI provide some sources and reading material at the bottom for\
    \ the curious\n\nThank you\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

  selftext: "Okay so I admit I have never actually fully read any of Nietzsche's work.\
    \ I have tried to read his work, specifically Beyond Good and Evil, Thus Spake\
    \ Zarathustra, and The Genealogy of Morality. I've honestly never really been\
    \ able to understand Nietzsche beyond the cliche explanations I've heard many\
    \ times.\n\n- The only understanding I have of Nietzsche, was that first of all\
    \ contrary to many people's beliefs, Nietzsche wasn't a nihilist and actually\
    \ was an existentialist. Nietzsche however apparently did a good job at explaining\
    \ nihilism, and thus this is where the misconception may have been born from.\
    \ \n\n- Nietzsche made the concept of the superman. The idea that man is a bridge\
    \ between ape and the superman. The superman is the person who lives for himself/herself\
    \ and goes beyond good and evil and all forms of traditional morality. The superman\
    \ makes up his own morality and his own meaning in his life.\n\n- I don't quite\
    \ understand this part at all, but I've heard that Nietzsche wanted the culture\
    \ to turn away from Christianity and turn to Greek romanticism.\n\n- He had a\
    \ big dislike of the philosophy of Plato and Western Philosophy. Why? I never\
    \ quite understood this, was it because Plato and Western philosophy put a lot\
    \ of importance on logic?\n\n- He made the quote \"God is Dead, and we killed\
    \ him\" which is a really popular quote. Maybe I'm dense, but why is this quote\
    \ so significant? As an atheist, I acknowledged long before I even knew who Nietzsche\
    \ was, that God was a concept made up by human beings. EDIT: I forgot to mention\
    \ that this quote also (or perhaps only) refers to the fact that religion was\
    \ dying in Western society. Science and the industrial revolution was becoming\
    \ more important in society, and Nietzsche believed it would ultimately kill religion\
    \ and it's values. The problem with science in Nietzsche's view was that it did\
    \ not give any values to people, thus when science kills religion, it would leave\
    \ people valueless and thus nihilistic.\n\n- Human beings main goal is the will\
    \ to power. Humans want power because that's what Nietzsche believed we were naturally\
    \ programmed to follow and that's how nature was.\n\n- He wanted to go back to\
    \ a morality of master morality rather than slave morality.\n\nOverall to be honest\
    \ I really don't understand why Nietzsche is so significant. So basically in a\
    \ nutshell Nietzsche wanted us to be free spirits, be individuals, and to not\
    \ be sheep. He wanted us to strive for power and to not be sheep that pity themselves\
    \ with morality such as Christianity.\n\n\nI feel like I'm being dense and not\
    \ understanding Nietzsche at all, because if this is all Nietzsche had to say,\
    \ then I'm not impressed. Yet at the same time I know Nietzsche is extremely popular,\
    \ so there must be more to him than I am seeing. It's difficult for me to read\
    \ Nietzsche because his writing style is so poetic and metaphorical, it's not\
    \ like other philosophers where their line of thinking is clear and logical. I\
    \ would be really disappointed if Nietzsche was popular mainly because of his\
    \ writing style and not because of his ideas.\n\nSo can anyone else please explain\
    \ to me Nietzsche more in depth rather than the typical cliche summaries I've\
    \ read about him over and over again?"

  selftext: "     On Logic and Knowledge\nLogic can simply be defined as the structure\
    \ of the relationship between concepts. A great portion of the following text\
    \ will be a lengthier definition of logic. However, another question of exploration\
    \ will be the role that logic plays in our deriving of knowledge. How concepts\
    \ are structured together is justly how logic is created. Knowledge is derived\
    \ through logic via the two main types of reasoning, induction and deduction.\n\
    \n     Logic\t\nLogic can be best divided into two branches of thought, deductive\
    \ reasoning and inductive reasoning. Both have been explored extensively separate\
    \ from one another due to the fact that when both deductive and inductive reasoning\
    \ are used to conclude the same argument, said argument can be considered circular.\
    \ Because of the structure of these two forms of thought \u2013 inductive and\
    \ deductive reasoning \u2013 they can only derive certain types of arguments;\
    \ sound and valid deductive logic can only produce conclusive arguments whilst\
    \ strong and reliable inductive logic can only produce probabilistic arguments.\
    \ \n\n     Deductive Logic\t\nNow, deductive logic concerns itself with taking\
    \ general arguments and bringing them to the particular instance. This means that\
    \ when a deductive argument is made, a general statement about the truth of how\
    \ the universe functions is created and that every particular instance involving\
    \ said deductive argument must cohere to the rules and laws set forth by said\
    \ deductive argument, else the particular instance does not involve the deductive\
    \ argument fully or the deductive argument is false. Deductive logic is not a\
    \ \u201Cprobability theory\u201D like inductive logic is; in fact, it is only\
    \ concerned with universal truths. \n\nTake the statement (c) \u201Call sharks\
    \ are fish\u201D as an example; we will now prove this statement to be true through\
    \ deductive logic. Justly we will now need a sound premise to prove this statement\
    \ true. A premise, put simply, is a reason that supports a conclusion, our conclusion\
    \ for this example is (c) \u201Csharks are fish.\u201D Our premises are (a) \u201C\
    all gill bearing animals are fish\u201D and (b) \u201Call sharks bear gills.\u201D\
    \ The truth of our conclusion is derived from the truth of our premises, so we\
    \ must prove of premises to be true, and once we do, it would be impossible for\
    \ our conclusion to be false; having true premises to an argument can be referred\
    \ to as having sound logic. Now, all fish have gills must be taken as true for\
    \ the mere fact that the definition of a fish are gill bearing animals; an animal\
    \ without gills cannot be a fish. Secondly, a shark is an animal that bears gills,\
    \ for if an animal is examined and it is found to not bear gills, it therefore\
    \ is impossible it can be a shark. Therefore, all sharks are fish. \n\nThis a\
    \ classic deductive reasoning skill called syllogism. Syllogism, simply put, is\
    \ an argument that contains two premises that support one conclusion. Syllogism\
    \ has been used to showcase its basic form of deductive argumentation and innate\
    \ certainty of conclusive truth.\n\n     Validity \nNow we will test this argument\
    \ for validity. The validity of an argument depends on if the conclusion follows\
    \ from the premises. Our conclusion for this example of sharks is based solely\
    \ upon our premises and follows them very closely. Thus, this argument is valid\
    \ because the conclusion (c), actually does follow, and is support by, the premises,\
    \ (a) and (b). Because our argument is valid we can now call our argument all-inclusive;\
    \ this means that the relationship between our premises is one hundred supportive\
    \ of our conclusion. Including all-inclusiveness, there are four main types of\
    \ relationships concepts can have. Overlap, is when the premises of an argument\
    \ dose not, with one hundred percent certainty, support the conclusion of an argument.\
    \ Next is if two concepts are mutually exclusive; which means the two concepts\
    \ have nothing to do with each other. Lastly, if two concepts share an identity\
    \ relationship, this simply means the concepts are really the exact same thing\
    \ with only different names. \nWe now move the discussion to inductive logic.\
    \ Unlike deductive logic, inductive logic is not concerned about the concrete\
    \ truth of ideas; in fact, inductive logic at best can only give a high probability\
    \ to a conclusion. Inductive reasoning is used when absolute truth is unattainable\
    \ or conclusive evidence cannot be produced. In this way, inductive logic can\
    \ be considered a \u201Cprobability theory\u201D that attempts to yield the highest\
    \ probabilistic conclusion; inductive argumentation is concerned about going from\
    \ the particular instance to the general in order to prove an argument true, or\
    \ highly probable.\n\n     Inductive Logic\nInduction is a highly useful skill\
    \ to master for the logician, yet, since it can never be used to prove undoubtable\
    \ truthfulness, it inherits many openings for debate about how it should be properly\
    \ used and applied. One such philosopher who continually contributed to the discussion\
    \ of inductive logic was Wesley C. Salmon, an American philosopher of science.\
    \ In his writing The Problem of Induction, when critically deducing his thoughts\
    \ upon inductive logic, he found that:\n\nHume\u2019s profound critique of induction\
    \ begins with a simple and apparently innocent question: How do we acquire knowledge\
    \ of the unobserved? This question, as posed, may seem to call for an empirical\
    \ answer. We observe roughly that human beings utilize what may be roughly characterized\
    \ as inductive of scientific methods of extending knowledge for the observed and\
    \ the unobserved. (Salmon 217)\n\nSalmon\u2019s quote exemplifies the modern debate\
    \ upon inductive logic and its intrinsic components. As a scientific tool, inductive\
    \ logic has assisted in the discovery of many physical laws of the universe. In\
    \ many ways, inductive logic has played one of the greatest roles in helping in\
    \ the deriving of knowledge. \n\n     Knowledge\nKnowledge, simply put, is true\
    \ justified belief; true, as in, knowledge is true as opposed to false; justified,\
    \ as in, knowledge is based upon justifiable arguments; belief, as in, one must\
    \ believe the knowledge to be true. Logic has aided in the deriving of knowledge\
    \ by applying its concepts to the core of said knowledge. The justification of\
    \ knowledge can be divided into three subcategories: experience, logic, and with\
    \ the combination of the two preceding subcategories, intuition. With the absence\
    \ of logic comes the absence of justification, and in turn, the absence of knowledge.\
    \ Whether it is either deductive or inductive logic that is used to derive knowledge\
    \ does not change the validity of said knowledge, if used properly; it does however\
    \ change the type of knowledge, as we have previously discussed. \n\n     Conclusion\n\
    Through the intricacies of logic can we find sound knowledge that is believable,\
    \ true, and most importantly \u2014 as far as logic is concerned \u2014 justifiable.\
    \ With inductive logic being the \u201Cprobability theory\u201D and deductive\
    \ logic being an absolute truth seeking device, knowledge can be derived from\
    \ these two simplistic forms. On logic and knowledge, these two interconnected\
    \ concepts create the basis of both truth and philosophy.\f\n     \n     Citation\n\

  selftext: "Let me make one thing clear initially, I find philosophy fascinating\
    \ but I haven't been academically trained so I am pretty clueless when it comes\
    \ to terms/definitions of certain schools/theories of philosophy.\n\n\n\nThe concept\
    \ of free will has been of great interest to me for a long time. I tend to think\
    \ of the human brain as simply a complex computer (I believe the term is \"Computational\
    \ Theory of Mind\"). After all, as far as we can tell with our current understanding\
    \ of neuroscience, the brain is simply a network of neurons firing electrical\
    \ signals to each other. \n\n\nThis realization leads me to believe that humans\
    \ don't truly have free will. Our actions are simply a product of external stimuli\
    \ entering the brain, being processed by a vast network of neurons (shaped by\
    \ memories and past experiences) and producing an output based on these factors,\
    \ probably with an element of randomness (or pseudo-randomness) involved.\n\n\n\
    Hypothetically, if the technological singularity was achieved, an identical, artificial\
    \ copy of my brain could be created, either through physical components or through\
    \ a simulated neural network on a computer system.\n\n\nTherefore, it would seem\
    \ that any of my actions could be predicted by using this artificial replica of\
    \ my brain, as long as the system had the capability to receive all the stimuli\
    \ that my own brain does (or at least simulate these stimuli accurately).\n\n\n\
    Now this concept scared me a little at first, because it seemed like strong evidence\
    \ for the idea of \"fate\", and that everything we do is predestined from the\
    \ moment we are born. I didn't like that idea at all. I was especially uncomfortable\
    \ with the idea of some sort of supercomputer being able to predict my actions\
    \ from the moment I was born, to my death.\n\n\nAfter thinking about this for\
    \ a year or two, I had an epiphany. What if we don't have free will, our future\
    \ is predestined, but there is no possible way of actually predicting our actions\
    \ due to the effects of chaos theory?\n\n\nLet me elaborate. Let's assume there\
    \ is an identical copy of my brain based in a computer system, with all my memories/genetic\
    \ traits etc. built in. Now hypothetically, if this \"cyber brain\" could interpret\
    \ all the same external stimuli as my \"real\" brain, it could predict my actions.\
    \ However, when we observe the incredible number of different stimuli entering\
    \ our brains, this task becomes tricky. \n\n\nFor example, we have billions of\
    \ photons entering our eyes every second, most of which are reflecting off other\
    \ objects. We have millions of particles of air hitting our eardrums every second.\
    \ Radiation waves and particles hitting our skin, and millions of molecules entering\
    \ our olfactory system.\n\n\nIf this wasn't complex enough, all of these stimuli\
    \ are continuously affected by everything else in the environment, from other\
    \ humans and living creatures moving around, to electrical appliances, motor vehicles\
    \ and extraterrestrial effects like the magnetic pull of the sun and moon. The\
    \ list goes on.\n\n\nMy hypothesis is, due to the incredible amount of complexity\
    \ of these stimuli, and how, being linked in the same system, they are susceptible\
    \ to chaos theory, one tiny change could make a huge difference within a short\
    \ amount of time. For example, a single photon could change its reflection angle\
    \ from an iron pipe, due the the iron atoms oxidising at that exact moment. This\
    \ photon could then enter a person's retina due to the change in direction, whereas\
    \ it would not have if the atoms in the pipe hadn't oxidised. \n\n\nThis single\
    \ photon could cause a person to change their behaviour, having a knock on \"\
    butterfly effect\", and chaos theory suggests that in some cases this single photon\
    \ could have a drastic effect on a huge number of people and the environment.\
    \ \n\n\nI suspect (although I haven't done the maths because a) I'm not a good\
    \ enough mathematician, and b) I don't have a clue how to estimate the complexity\
    \ of the stimuli in question and how much they affect one another), that there\
    \ wouldn't be enough computing power in the whole universe to actually predict\
    \ someone's behaviour over more than a few seconds.\n\n\nSo, my hypothesis suggests\
    \ that, even if we reach the technological singularity and can produce an artificial\
    \ brain as complex as the human brain, the sheer complexity of external stimuli\
    \ and how they interact would make a \"prediction computer\" almost useless, due\
    \ to the effects of chaos theory. \n\n\nMy conclusion would be that we probably\
    \ don't have free will, but if no-one can actually predict our behaviour then\
    \ does it really matter? I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of us having\
    \ no free will if it can't be effectively predicted.\n\n\nSome assumptions are\
    \ being made in this hypothesis, one being that random quantum phenomena have\
    \ no effect on consciousness (which would probably make a prediction computer\
    \ totally impossible). ANother assumption is that we are not already living in\
    \ a simulation, which would render the \"processing power of the universe\" a\
    \ moot point.\n\nAnother possibility is that we could create an \"imperfect prediction\
    \ computer\" that gave probabilities of certain behaviours, rather than certainties.\
    \ However, if there was a number of these computers, all predicting different\
    \ people's behaviours, the chaos theory effect would set in again and lower their\
    \ accuracy.\n\n\nI'm sure that this has been discussed by philosophers before,\
    \ and I've probably made some other assumptions that I'm not aware of. But I would\
    \ be grateful if anyone could post any links to similar discussions, and also\
    \ point out any flaws in my reasoning. "

  selftext: "To be clear, I mean for intellectual reasons, not practical ones.\n\n\
    Are there any good reasons for accepting religious beliefs or claims as legitimate\
    \ (read: *true*)?  To my knowledge, religious claims about the nature of the cosmos\
    \ are not supported (or often even *capable* of being supported or refuted) by\
    \ empirical evidence.  So while some religious doctrine may demonstrate a degree\
    \ of internal logical consistency, no religious doctrine to my knowledge is fully\
    \ consistent with the external observable universe.  This assertion is not at\
    \ all controversial among scientists.  \n\nOne definition of faith is belief in\
    \ the absence of evidence.  Faith is sometimes regarded as a virtue.  It is even\
    \ regarded as a source of morality.\n\nI realize that this is not /r/atheism.\
    \  *Philosophically*, why should I regard the earnest and impassioned belief in\
    \ unsupported claims as anything except a hazardous mark of gullibility, stupidity,\
    \ and infantile wishful thinking?\n\n**EDIT: RESULTS**\n\nLots and LOTS of comments.\
    \  Here is a summary of the arguments that posters have offered:\n\n-1. **[Argument\
    \ from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).** Theism\
    \ has been around a long time, it has been part of philosophy for a long time,\
    \ take its claims seriously because *Respect. Mah. Authoritah!*  Um. No.\n\n-2.\
    \ **[Argument from popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum).**\
    \ Billions of people have religious beliefs, so out of respect for *them* we should\
    \ respect their ideas.  No.  We can respect a person while criticizing specific\
    \ ideas they have or claims they make.\n\n-3. **Don't be a meanie.**  Religion\
    \ deserves special treatment because it is important to people.  No.  No other\
    \ category of ideas gets a free pass from harsh criticism - not political ideas,\
    \ not scientific ideas, not philosophical ideas, not even personal preferences\
    \ in art, music, or literature.  Religious beliefs have no special claim to automatic\
    \ respect.\n\n-4. **Empiricism is overrated, and isn't used in everyday life.**\n\
    \nNonsense.  Empiricism makes technology possible, so you don't get to say it\
    \ is useless or meaningless or anything other that stone-cold-amazeballs-awesome\
    \ *while typing on a computer*.\n\nMoreover, we continuously rely on empiricism.\
    \  Our personal models of reality - from the physics of walking, to what is edible\
    \ and what is not, to how other people will respond to our behavior, and a billion\
    \ other examples - are all empirical.  They are the cumulative result of our comparing\
    \ predictions our models make with the external world.  As adults, these models\
    \ rarely fail.  That's what makes magicians awesome: they have tricks for breaking\
    \ our personal empirical models of reality.  Science just extends empiricism beyond\
    \ the reach of everyday human experience.  If walking on the moon were an everyday\
    \ experience, our ancestors would never have thought it was made of spirits or\
    \ cheese or whatever else.\n\nOK, on to some more serious responses.\n\n-5. **Empirically-supported\
    \ claims are no more legitimate that faith-based claims, because empiricism is\
    \ also based on *a priori* assumptions.**\n\nIt is true that empirical knowledge\
    \ is based on the assumption that consistency is useful.  However, to claim that\
    \ this puts empirical and faith claims on level footing is to arrive at the fallacy\
    \ of false equivalence via *reductio ad absurdum*.  Empiricism is special; it\
    \ has a unique type of self-evident utility.\n\nDivineSleeper explains: \"To refute\
    \ consistency itself, however, leaves nothing but insanity. You simply cannot\
    \ actively believe that the universe now will be zero indication of the universe\
    \ a few seconds from now.\"\n\n-6. **Religious beliefs are useful.**\n\nI specifically\
    \ asked for *intellectual*, not *practical*, arguments for the legitimacy of religious\
    \ claims about the nature of the cosmos.  Folks ignored this.  Here is the difference:\n\
    \nReligious claims have *practical utility* with respect to an individual's psychology:\
    \ they sometimes have a pro-social effect on how we feel, think, and behave. \
    \ \n\nEmpiricism has *epistemic utility*: it allows us to build a framework of\
    \ claims that is both self-consistent and consistent with the external universe\
    \ it attempts to describe.  Religious claims appear to have little or no epistemic\
    \ utility.\n\n-7. **KGDavid says \"If theism is not true, the door is closed on\
    \ a number of philosophical possibilities ... Whether or not theism is true, its\
    \ truth or untruth has great consequence on our understanding of morality, epistemology,\
    \ and ontology.\"**\n\nThis is a fair point.  But it is also true that if Zeus\
    \ were real it would have \"great consequence on our understanding of morality,\
    \ epistemology, and ontology\".  I think the likelihood of both are very close\
    \ to zero.  Is it worth spending time and energy considering such an unlikely\
    \ scenario when there is so much other philosophy to learn about?  Not to me.\n\
    \n-8. **Various ontological arguments.**\n\nI find that the [standard objections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Criticisms_and_objections)\
    \ dispense with these [quite easily](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/#ObjOntArg).\
    \  \n\nThe objection that resonates most with me is that causation is meaningless\
    \ without time, and modern physics seems to suggest that [reality is larger than\
    \ our own space-time universe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=7ImvlS8PLIo#t=138s).\
    \  Asking what happened before time existed is meaningless: it is like asking\
    \ what is north of the North Pole.  Without time then causation, creation, and\
    \ a Creator are similarly meaningless concepts.  This does a good job of obviating\
    \ the First Cause infinite regress paradox.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT: [busted](http://i.imgur.com/B5ZLnHo.jpg).**"

  selftext: "In [part II.A](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/4jvg3x/kierkegaards_on_the_occasion_of_a_confession_part/)\
    \ of \u201COn the Occasion of a Confession,\u201D Kierkegaard argued that really\
    \ to will one thing in truth requires willing *the good* in truth, and that this,\
    \ in turn, means renouncing all forms of double-mindedness. In part II.B, Kierkegaard\
    \ first gives us a helpful summary of what came before and a brief intro to the\
    \ next stage of the discourse. (See the text [quoted in full](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialChristian/comments/4khfkq/kierkegaards_summary_of_parts_i_and_iia_of_on_the/)\
    \ over at /r/ExistentialChristian.) This part of the discourse is entitled \u201C\
    *If a person is to will the good in truth, he must will to do everything for the\
    \ good or will to suffer everything for the good*.\u201D It divides quite naturally\
    \ into two sections. The first treats what it means to will to \u201Cdo everything\u201D\
    \ for the good (*UDVS*, pp. 79-99), the second, what it means to \u201Csuffer\
    \ everything\u201D for the good (ibid., pp. 99-121).\n\nIn treating what it means\
    \ to do everything for the good, the first section avoids \u201Cproliferating\
    \ the details to the point of confusion and distraction,\u201D but instead \u201C\
    simplif[ies] all this in its essential unity and equality by saying that to will\
    \ to do everything is: *to will, in the decision, to be and to remain with the\
    \ good*, because the decision is precisely the decisive everything, just as it\
    \ is the essential one thing\u201D (p. 79). Why not merely \u2018to be with the\
    \ good\u2019? Because it is a common theme throughout Kierkegaard\u2019s writings\
    \ that striving for the good is a lifelong task. So the phrase \u2018to remain\u2019\
    \ is there to prevent confusing the decision with \u201Cthe quixotism of a high-minded\
    \ moment\u201D (p. 80).\n\nThen, already anticipating the next section, the discourse\
    \ notes that \u201Cin this expression [i.e., \u2018to be and to remain with the\
    \ good\u2019] the equality is maintained that recognizes no distinctions with\
    \ regard to that more essential diversity of life or of the human condition: to\
    \ be acting or to be suffering, since the one who is suffering can [just as well],\
    \ in the decision, also be with the good\u201D (p. 80). Contained in this little\
    \ remark is an argument that shall recur in the next section, one which subtly\
    \ critiques forms of the capitalist mentality that define the value of the human\
    \ person chiefly in terms of action or labor. For although \u201Cthe external\
    \ world is assigned as a stage,\u201D the good, the eternal, \u201Cdoes not recognize\
    \ all the corruptive strife and comparison that condescends and insults, that\
    \ sighs and envies\u201D\u2014no, the eternal\u2019s \u201Crequirement is equal\
    \ for everyone, the greatest who has lived and the lowliest\u201D (p. 81). \n\n\
    Kierkegaard proceeds to discuss the \u201Cdangerous\u201D but \u201Cgreat\u201D\
    \ power of human \u201Csagacity.\u201D In many of his writings, sagacity is understood\
    \ negatively, but here we see that it is, though still dangerous, capable of being\
    \ used for the good. First, however, the *abuses* of sagacity are stated. Inwardly\
    \ sagacity is used to keep oneself \u201Cfrom stepping out into the decision,\u201D\
    \ used \u201C*to seek evasion*\u201D (p. 82). Sagacity\u2019s evasions are many:\
    \ exaggerated self-concern, purported weakness, alleged personal insignificance,\
    \ familial responsibilities, the practical need to hedge one\u2019s bets, etc.\
    \ etc. etc. (see pp. 82-85). Then the discourse becomes pathos-filled as it personifies\
    \ recollection which, as the voice of conscience, vociferously condemns \u201C\
    the double-minded person, inveigled by sagacity\u201D (p. 86). Here the discourse\
    \ also anticipates, again, themes of Kierkegaard\u2019s later work, *The Sickness\
    \ Unto Death*, asking \u201Cwhat does it profit the sick person to imagine, what\
    \ everyone thinks, that he is healthy when the physician declares: He is sick!\u201D\
    \ (p. 87). But sagacity is also misused in another way: externally, as *deception*.\
    \ And \u201Cthe secret of the deception to which all manifestations of it can\
    \ be traced in one way or another is this: that it is not human beings, after\
    \ all, who stand in need of the good, but the good that stands in need of human\
    \ beings\u201D (p. 87). And so perhaps, it is thought, a crowd is necessary, perhaps\
    \ the poorest and weakest are incapable of the good; thus the majority is fooled,\
    \ the world is fooled, and the good\u2019s \u201Cgreatness is to be compared to\
    \ a piece of property that one individual does not have enough money to buy, and\
    \ therefore a campaign for funds becomes necessary\u201D (p. 88). Oh, but once\
    \ again recollection knows better\u2014even if it takes the recollection of eternity\
    \ before accounts are settled and the deception is revealed (p. 88).\n\nBefore\
    \ moving on to the ways sagacity can be *properly* used, the discourse examines\
    \ the notion that the sagacious person *accomplishes much*. Now, if we had forgot\
    \ that this is a *religious* discourse\u2014did it not begin with a prayer?\u2014\
    at this point it becomes especially manifest. Here, as the discourse demonstrates\
    \ the problems entailed in thinking that temporality, the bogus world system of\
    \ human sagacity, could ever be \u201Cthe *uniform transparency* of the eternal,\u201D\
    \ it takes on a specifically Christian mood, pointing its Christian audience to\
    \ God on the cross. For if the eternal and the temporal corresponded perfectly,\
    \ \u201Cin that case it could never have occurred in temporality (to mention the\
    \ supreme and the most terrible example but also the example explaining everything)\
    \ that God\u2019s son, when he was revealed in human form, was crucified, rejected\
    \ by temporality; in the eternal sense he certainly willed the eternal, and yet\
    \ he became recognizable in temporality by being rejected and thus accomplished\
    \ but little\u201D (p. 89). This argument essentially foreshadows Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s *Practice in Christianity*, another work authored by his pseudonym Anti-Climacus,\
    \ and it continues on for a few pages (pp. 89-93). *Nota bene*: It is not without\
    \ reason that Kierkegaard brings Christ and the apostles to our mind at this juncture:\
    \ though they are not mentioned directly in the paragraphs that follow, they are\
    \ clear exemplars of those who will the good in truth and use sagacity properly.\n\
    \nWhat, then, does it mean for one who wills the good in truth to use sagacity\
    \ properly? Here we can be briefer, as it is simply a subversion of the above\
    \ misuses: inwardly, such a person uses sagacity to prevent evasions (pp. 93-94);\
    \ outwardly, to prevent deceptions\u2014\u201Cto preclude, if possible, the illusions\
    \ [of temporality], lest he himself illegitimately come to gain advantage from\
    \ the good (gain money, distinction, and admiration) or deceive anyone by a delusive\
    \ appearance\u201D (p. 95). In short, human sagacity is not, in itself, evil or\
    \ sinful, but rather \u201Ca good thing\u201D (p. 95) that is capable of misuse.\
    \ Unfortunately, according to Kierkegaard, it is misused more often than not.\
    \ For \u201Cbecause the world is more allied with the mediocre than with the truly\
    \ good, precisely for that reason he will accomplish, in the sense of the moment,\
    \ much less by not yielding, by not bargaining, by not making himself cozy and\
    \ comfortable, by not wanting to have advantage for himself\u2026\u201D (p. 98).\n\
    \nIn the second section of part II.B, the discussion shifts to what it means to\
    \ \u2018suffer\u2019 everything for the good. Several things must be observed.\
    \ First, the discourse claims that those who act also suffer, and that willing\
    \ to *act* and willing to *suffer* for the good are equally instances of willing\
    \ \u201C*to be and to remain with the good*.\u201D (So, as above, Kierkegaard\
    \ rejects a strict dichotomy, and argues for what we might call \u2018existential\
    \ capacity egalitarianism\u2019.) Second, not all voluntary suffering has this\
    \ character, but only suffering that is *for the sake of the good*. Third, what\
    \ distinguishes the sufferer-for-the-good from the doer-for-the-good is that the\
    \ suffering of the latter \u201Chas significance for the victory of the good in\
    \ the world; whereas when the sufferer takes upon himself the sufferings allotted\
    \ to him,\u201D he does so \u201Cin order that the good may be victorious in him\u201D\
    \ (p. 99).\n\nBut if the sufferer does not act in the external world\u2014does\
    \ not, as we say, make a difference\u2014then what is left? Here the discourse\
    \ makes another important distinction. Whereas \u201Cfaith and hope are the relation\
    \ to the eternal through the will,\u201D suffering is defined in terms of \u201C\
    the *wish*,\u201D which is \u201Cthe sufferer\u2019s relation to a happier temporality\u201D\
    \ (p. 99). Kierkegaard is more Aristotelian than Stoic in this passage, as he\
    \ writes, \u201CIt is a kind of spiritual suicide to want to kill the wish, because\
    \ we are not speaking of wishes [of any arbitrary sort] but of the wish with the\
    \ essential accent of excellence\u2026\u201D (p. 100). He then distinguishes the\
    \ wish, along with hope and faith, from various pseudo-versions of each (pp. 100-101).\
    \ Next he moves from the internal side of suffering to comment upon the external\
    \ side. Inwardly suffering is related to a happier set of temporal conditions,\
    \ but outwardly what is \u201Cessential\u201D is \u201Cthat the sufferer does\
    \ not benefit others by his suffering\u201D and may even be \u201Ca burden instead\u201D\
    \ (p. 103). Kierkegaard addresses the suffering one directly: \u201CNo one, not\
    \ even the greatest person who has ever lived, can do more than you,\u201D for\
    \ the language \u201Cof the hopelessness of useless sufferings\u201D is \u201C\
    merely human talk\u201D (p. 104). Some have argued that Kierkegaard probably has\
    \ in mind his physically disabled nephew, Hans Peter Kierkegaard (as also the\
    \ chapter in *Works of Love*, \u201CMercifulness, a Work of Love Even If It Can\
    \ Give Nothing and Is Able to Do Nothing). Accordingly, though it is peripheral\
    \ to the theme of the discourse, Kierkegaard would likely have something to say\
    \ concerning the relationship between disability and a work-based construction\
    \ of identity (see, for starters, Galer\u2019s \u201C[Disabled Capitalists: Exploring\
    \ the Intersections of Disability and Identity Formation in the World of Work](http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/3277/3122)\u201D\
    ).\n\nKierkegaard is careful not to turn away, abruptly and inconsiderately, from\
    \ the experience of suffering: \u201CIt is indeed beneficial not to leave suffering\
    \ too soon. *Let us dwell on it properly, convinced that there is no remedy more\
    \ beneficial against the pernicious sickness of busyness than to consider properly\
    \ the hard fate of those who suffer essentially*, and then very humanly to sympathize\
    \ with them in the common concern of suffering\u201D (p. 104). He observes that\
    \ as sufferings become increasingly more difficult, our sympathy tends to become\
    \ weary and sometimes even bitter if the suffering drags on. A parable of a solitary\
    \ but sentient horse is then used to depict the isolation of misunderstood suffering\
    \ (excerpted as \u2018The Lonely Horse\u2019 in *Parables of Kierkegaard*, ed.\
    \ Oden, pp. 27-8).\n\nThe discourse speaks at length of the sufferer, and of how\
    \ the sufferer\u2019s contrast with those who enjoy a happy childhood and youth,\
    \ a happy love and marriage, shows that these things are not the highest (pp.\
    \ 108ff.). Again he addresses the sufferer directly: \u201CO you suffering one,\
    \ even if you cannot \u2026 do something for others, and this is part of your\
    \ suffering, you can still do\u2014the highest; you can will to suffer everything\
    \ and thereby in the decision be with the good\u201D (p. 111). And in response\
    \ to the question of whether one can ever be said to \u201Cwill\u201D suffering,\
    \ Kierkegaard remarks, \u201Clet us above all distinguish between what it is to\
    \ will in the sense of desire and what it is to will in the noble sense of freedom\u201D\
    \ (p. 117). Kierkegaard brings in the virtues of courage and patience to articulate\
    \ the latter sense of freedom. Whereas courage \u201Cgoes freely into the suffering\
    \ that could be avoided,\u201D patience \u201Cmakes itself free in the unavoidable\
    \ suffering\u201D (p. 119). In short, there are ways of responding to \u2018unavoidable\
    \ suffering\u2019 that are in keeping with pursuit of the good, and there are\
    \ unhealthy ways of responding that are not.\n\nFinally, after another brief recap\
    \ (p. 120), Kierkegaard waxes poetic about purity of heart. The following is but\
    \ an excerpt: \u201CPurity of heart\u2014this is a metaphorical expression that\
    \ compares the heart to the ocean, and why specifically to that? Because the ocean\u2019\
    s depth is its purity, and its purity is its transparency, because the ocean is\
    \ deep only when it is pure, and pure only when it is transparent. \u2026 When\
    \ \u2026 it is deeply and transparently pure, then, however long one continues\
    \ to look at it, it is one thing; then its purity is this constancy in one thing.\
    \ \u2026 Just as the ocean, when it lies still this way, deeply transparent, aspires\
    \ to heaven, so the pure heart, when it is still, deeply transparent, aspires\
    \ solely to the good\u201D (p. 121).\n\n*Next:* The final section of \u201COn\
    \ the Occasion of a Confession,\u201D concluding our reading of Part One of *Upbuilding\
    \ Discourses in Various Spirits*."

  selftext: "This is from a letter that Nietzsche wrote to Lou Salom\xE9 when she\
    \ was beginning to write philosophy, and appears in her book on his work.\n\n\
    Toward the Teaching of Style\n\n1. Of prime necessity is life: a style should\
    \ *live.*\n\n2. Style should be suited to the specific person with whom you wish\
    \ to communicate. (The law of *mutual relation.*)\n\n3. First, one must determine\
    \ precisely \"what-and-what do I wish to say and *present*,\" before you may write.\
    \ Writing must be mimicry.\n\n4. Since the writer *lacks* many of the speaker's\
    \ *means,* he must in general have for his model a *very expressive* kind of presentation;\
    \ of necessity, the written copy will appear much paler.\n\n5. The richness of\
    \ life reveals itself through a *richness of gestures.* One must *learn* to feel\
    \ everything--the length and retarding of sentences, interpunctuation, the choice\
    \ of words, the pausing, the sequence of arguments--like gestures.\n\n6. Be careful\
    \ with periods! Only those people who also have long duration of breath while\
    \ speaking are entitled to periods. With most people, the period is a matter of\
    \ affectation.^^^1\n\n\n7. Style ought to prove that one *believes* in an idea;\
    \ not only thinks it but also *feels* it.\n\n8. The more abstract a truth one\
    \ wishes to teach, the more one must first *entice* the senses.\n\n9. Strategy\
    \ on the part of the good writer of prose consists of choosing his means for stepping\
    \ close to poetry but *never* stepping into it.\n\n10. It is not good manners\
    \ or clever to deprive one's readers of the most obvious objections. It is very\
    \ good manners and *very clever* to leave it to one's readers alone to prononce\
    \ the ultimate quintessence of our wisdom.\n\n^^^1 [Note: German sentences are\
    \ usually long with multiple clauses for building a bigger point, while shorter\
    \ sentences are seen as overly-simple-sounding in a lot of cases. Nietzsche's\
    \ short sentences are often remarked on for being impacted and a novelty in German\
    \ prose.]"

  selftext: "Hello redditors, I am fairly new to this subreddit and I am not exactly\
    \ sure if this is the place to post this so please let me know if it is not. \n\
    \nI am currently finishing up a semester long preliminary course on Modern Philosophy\
    \ in my high school and went to the theaters recently and watched the film, Batman\
    \ V Superman: Dawn of Justice. Love it or hate it, I thought important character\
    \ motivations were built around major philosophical themes and ideas and I wanted\
    \ to share and hear what other thought. (Spoilers of course)\n\nFirst of all I\
    \ think Batman's arc in this film is largely a transition from moral absolutism\
    \ to moral objectivity and back to absolutism again. At the beginning of the film,\
    \ in this quote, it is clear that Batman in his earlier days was a moral absolutist:\n\
    \n\"There was a time above... a time before... there were perfect things... diamond\
    \ absolutes. But things fall... things on earth. And what falls... is fallen.\
    \ In the dream, it took me to the light. A beautiful lie.\" -Batman\n\nHe references\
    \ to him falling both literally into a cave and from the perfection of his moral\
    \ standards in addition to how absolutism is a beautiful lie, reveals that he\
    \ no longer believes that moral absolutism is a viable path for him to be successful\
    \ in Gotham taking down criminals. This is why he starts branding and killing\
    \ criminals under his new idea that it will deter them. This of course was due\
    \ to the death of Robin, supposedly at the hands of the Joker, who Batman up to\
    \ this point in his career has not killed him due to his moral standards. This\
    \ has lead to the Batman rethinking how to stop criminals because after all, putting\
    \ someone like the Joker in jail will simply delay his inevitable escape and further\
    \ death of future people. \n\n\"Criminals are like weeds, Alfred; pull one up,\
    \ another grows in its place.\" -Batman\n\nBatman has always thought as himself\
    \ as a symbol of something greater than criminals because of the fact that he\
    \ does not do to the criminals what they do to others. But now, he is willing\
    \ to sink to their level to be able to get what he wants done and is willing to\
    \ kill and torture to save others.   \n\n\"We're criminals, Alfred. We've always\
    \ been criminals.\" -Batman\n\nTo say the least, it seems as though Batman has\
    \ given up on moral absolutism, because he has lost hope in the goodness of humanity.\
    \ Furthermore, he sees Superman has an alien possessing no form of morality or\
    \ regard for human life because of the destruction in Metropolis. Although it\
    \ may seem that Batman is also lacking morals it is just that he is willing to\
    \ do anything to save the innocent in a very Deontologist-like way. Essentially,\
    \ Superman's existence is a threat to Batman because he feels that Superman is\
    \ an uncontrollable God-like alien. \n\n\"That son of a bitch [Superman] brought\
    \ the war to us two years ago. Jesus, Alfred, count the dead... thousands of people.\
    \ What's next? Millions? He has the power to wipe out the entire human race, and\
    \ if we believe there's even a one percent chance that he is our enemy we have\
    \ to take it as an absolute certainty... and we have to destroy him.\" -Batman\n\
    \nAnd in this sense, Superman is a complete foil to Batman's morals. Superman\
    \ has faith that humanity will act positively and he seems to be a hard moral\
    \ absolutist. Throughout the film Superman views Batman has being above the law\
    \ and unchecked because in many cases the police and government sanction the painful\
    \ things that Batman does to criminals. \n\n\"Civil liberties are being trampled\
    \ on in your city; good people living in fear. I've seen it, Mr. Wayne. He thinks\
    \ he's above the law.\" -Superman\n\nHowever, even Superman's faith in humanity\
    \ is lost in the film after one encounter with Batman and Lex Luthor (who I will\
    \ talk about later). This I think is also what leads him to ultimately fight Batman\
    \ instead of reason with him, because he lose faith that Batman will act to help\
    \ Superman, and thus Superman loses his sense of moral absolutism briefly while\
    \ fighting Batman. \n\n\"No one stays good in this world.\" -Superman \n\nNow\
    \ during the Doomsday battle, Superman is instilled with the idea of moral absolutism\
    \ once again and decides to sacrifice himself for a world that has rejected him\
    \ multiple times and has really disliked Superman. This act of selflessness is\
    \ what really snaps Batman back into being a moral absolutist again and that also\
    \ allows him to have faith in humanity. When he goes to see Lex Luthor in jail,\
    \ he could have easily branded him, because Lex is arguably the one who most deserves\
    \ the brand but he does not. I believe that this is a very clear visual representation\
    \ of the fact that Batman is done with his old ways and is inspired by his former\
    \ ideals. \n\n\"Men are still good. We fight, we kill, we betray one another,\
    \ but we can rebuild. We can do better. We will. We have to.\" -Batman\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nNow another character I feel whose motivations are really influenced through\
    \ philosophy is Lex Luthor. This iteration of Luthor has been definitely the most\
    \ controversial but I think he is the most interesting. Like in all versions,\
    \ Lex Luthor hates Superman, but his reasons for hating Superman are very different\
    \ and are centered around the Problem of Evil. Lex sees that people treat Superman\
    \ as a God, but Lex sees Superman as a false god. Luthor also believes that if\
    \ there was a God, that being never intervened to help him from the evil in the\
    \ world which he describes as abuses from his father. \n\n\"The problem of you\
    \ on top of everything else. You above all. Ah. 'Cause that's what God is. Horus.\
    \ Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El. Clark Joseph Kent. See. What we call God depends upon\
    \ our tribe, Clark Jo. Because God is tribal. God take sides. No man in the sky\
    \ intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy's fist and abominations.\
    \ Mm mm. I've figured it out way back, if God is all powerful, he cannot be all\
    \ good. And if he's all good then he cannot be all powerful. And neither can you\
    \ be. They need to see the fraud you are. With their eyes. The blood on your hands.\"\
    \ -Lex Luthor\n\nAnd here is where Luthor's plan unfolds beautifully each scenario\
    \ describing an aspect of the Problem of Evil. If Superman kills Batman to save\
    \ his mother, then the world will see Superman as not \"all-good\" and if he is\
    \ omnibenevolent and allows Batman to kill him, then he is no longer \"all-powerful.\"\
    \ And how can one be a God without both of these attributes (at least in the Western\
    \ definition of God). In the slight chance, that Superman and Batman resolve their\
    \ difference to collectively defeat Luthor, he would have made Doomsday, or the\
    \ Devil to kill Superman. In the end however, Luthor is actually ultimately right\
    \ because of Superman's omnibenevolence, he decides to sacrifice himself to kill\
    \ Doomsday, but it now shows that he is not omnipotent. \n\n\"There we go. There\
    \ we go. And now God, bends to my will.\" -Lex Luthor\n\nLet me know what you\
    \ think of my analysis of the film and please add anything you think of from the\
    \ film or anything. Thank you for reading. \n "

  selftext: 'So, I''m starting to suspect that the idea that we might (or might not)
    be actually living "in" a simulation .. is not a meaningful idea.


    Let''s assume for the moment that (1) you''re a materialist, and you believe that
    cognition, self-awareness, intelligence, etc. are the output of computations (say)
    of the human brain.


    Let''s further assume that (2) we eventually develop artificial intelligence,
    maybe in a giant Game of Life, maybe some other way.


    Unlike a robot brain, the AI we create isn''t wired up to perceive the outside
    world, only events in its own simulated world - in essence, we''ve created a simulated
    universe (which may follow different laws than our own). So there''s a society
    of simulated beings all chatting away with one another, or whatever they''re doing.
    These aren''t video game characters, mere sprites, these are rich, thinking beings
    that - when wired up to our world - behave just as richly as humans (though their
    thought processes and mental architecture might be very different), that just
    happen to be experiencing a completely virtual world.


    Are these beings having a real experience, like we do? It would seem so, following
    from (1).


    If you''re still with me, here''s where it gets weird. Is their experience somehow
    reliant on us running the simulation? Does it matter?


    At first, it seems so. After all, if we never run the simulation, no experience
    for them, right?


    Consider: if we pause the simulation, wait five minutes, and restart it, they''d
    never know. All their brains would freeze, along with everything in their little
    simulated universe, and be restarted, and they''d be none the wiser. In fact,
    if it''s deterministic (like Conway''s Game of Life) we could even rewind it a
    little and replay it. They''re still motoring on like nothing had happened. These
    disturbances don''t affect them at all.


    We can run it at half speed, double speed, or alternate between the two, and none
    of this affects the experience of the beings ''inside'' the simulation, since
    all of their physical processes speed up or slow down in lock step.


    In fact, run it backwards for a few years, turn it off, and when we get to the
    year 2076, start it over from the beginning. They still have no idea.


    To go further, if the simulated universe happened to have deterministic, reversible
    physical laws, we could (having at some earlier time worked out the end state),
    run it backwards.  This won''t lead to the beings inside experiencing any oddness,
    since their simulated arrow of entropy still points toward the simulated world''s
    ''past''.


    It seems to me that the experience of these simulated beings is only loosely connected
    - if at all - to how and when we run our simulator.


    There are other ways to illustrate this looseness.  Take ''hashlife'', for instance
    - it''s one of the engines that can run Conway''s Game of Life. One of its advantages
    is its speed, which it achieves by looking for patches of the universe that are
    identical to other patches it has seen before.


    When this happens, rather than calculating the evolution of that newly found identical
    patch, it just looks up what happened last time and injects it into the future.


    Let''s say that a small part of the brain of being ''0'' duplicates a small part
    of the brain of being ''3222'' (possibly millions of ''years'' later). Does 3222
    not get to experience'' of that bit of thinking if we computed it earlier?


    I think we can''t say this - after all, how do we know that the calculation was
    "really for" brain 0 when we first ran it? (I assert this is an arbitrary assignment.)
    It could be that we "really" ran the calculation for brain 3222 early, and it
    was brain 0 that somehow missed out on experiencing its cognitive process. I don''t
    think it''s either.


    What''s clear is that if we don''t run the simulation, *we* don''t know what happens
    in the simulated world. (I can''t show my nephew a picture of SimWorld on simdate
    212202.02, just like I can''t show him the billionth digit of Pi until I work
    it out.)


    But I don''t think that necessarily means the inhabitants don''t experience their
    reality.  My suspicion is that "simulating" is entirely for the benefit of the
    simulators, exploring alternative realities. If those parts of reality are structured
    in such a way as to contain conscious life, then I suspect that life experiences
    itself *regardless of whether or not anyone simulates it.*'

  selftext: '"Arguing semantics" seems to have become this subreddit''s default obscure
    criticism. People accuse each other of arguing semantics when they:


    * ask for someone to clarify what they mean by a particular word;

    * suggest that someone is using a word nonstandardly;

    * distinguish between two different senses of a word; or

    * say anything that has anything to do with language.


    But most often, "arguing semantics" is thrown out as a vague platitude, as when
    people accuse academic philosophy as a whole of boiling down to semantic arguments.


    When "semantics" is used as loosely as it tends to here, the obvious question
    is what the significance of that observation is supposed to be. After all, I could
    say that the Kalaam cosmological argument is "just arguing modus ponens," or that
    the proof that there are an infinitely many primes is "just a reductio ad absurdum."
    But so what? There''s nothing wrong with those forms of argument; the fact that
    I can give them a label hardly changes that. So the same goes for "arguing semantics."
    If you think someone is arguing semantics, you ought not to stop there. Instead,
    ask what *difference* it makes that that their argument hinges on a distinction,
    or a particular usage of a word, or what have you. If you find that the real problem
    is that someone is drawing an *irrelevant* distinction, why not just say that?
    Far more clear than just accusing them of "arguing semantics."


    "Semantics" is the study of meaning. Not questions about the meanings of particular
    words ("Does doing right mean maximizing happiness?") but about how words and
    other signs relate to their meanings in general. When people argue about this
    topic - for example, when they argue about whether the content of my thoughts
    depends on their causal history - you could properly say that they are arguing
    about semantics. But in every example I''ve actually seen, "arguing semantics"
    is thrown up just to mean that somebody is, in any way at all, paying close attention
    to a particular word. If that''s a problem in some particular case, then do explain
    why. But in the meantime, don''t waste your time on this cliched and hopelessly
    vague criticism.'

  selftext: Suppose we discover how to make a teletransporter that works like the
    one on Star Trek. It decomposes your body and your brain and records all the information
    about them. It then radios a signal to Mars, where another machine uses raw materials
    on Mars to create a person who perfectly duplicates you. This person walks and
    talks just like you. It thinks it's you. It seems to remember your life. Would
    this person be you? Would you survive going through this teletransporter? Or would
    this person on Mars merely be a copy of you? Would you use such a teletransporter?
    Is it a way to travel, or a way to commit suicide while creating a copy of yourself?
    If the person on the other side is just a copy and you are dead does this suggest
    that we consist of something immaterial?

  selftext: 'Few nights back, I was at a barbeque and ended up discussing morals and
    other subjects with a good friend of mine and his new hippie GF. To get straight
    to the point, she eventually told me that science is merely an opinion, that theories
    are just another way of saying "We don''t know, so we guess" and that logic and
    rationality is purely subjective. I excused myself and ended the conversation.
    I thought that since she considers something like science as an opinion, and something
    like logic to be subjective, there was no point in keep talking with her since
    she''d just keep feeling justified in dismissing everything I had said with "Well,
    that''s like, your opinion."


    But later that night i realized that I wouldn''t have known how to respond to
    it even if I hadn''t had a valid excuse to duck out. This is the first time I''ve
    actually heard the statement "... an opinion" in real life, and I was taken aback.
    In hind sight, I would''ve liked to jolt her back into the world of science and
    rational thinking. How do you in /r/philosophy deal with this kind of thing when
    encountered?'

  selftext: "Too often, I think, viewers of the Matrix are intrigued by the possibility\
    \ that 'real' life could be a computer simulation. In fact, the film is much more\
    \ than a simple 'brain in a vat' allegory. What is the Matrix? Control.\n\nThere\
    \ is an old anecdote about an experiment involving monkeys. I don't know if this\
    \ ever an actual experiment or just a story meant to enlighten. Regardless, I\
    \ mention it now. Five monkeys were placed in a cage and a treat was repeatedly\
    \ placed in a dish. Each time one of the monkeys went to grab the treat, the other\
    \ 4 monkeys were sprayed with water. Eventually, when one of the monkeys went\
    \ for the treat, the other four would beat him up or restrain him before he could\
    \ get to it; they didn't like being sprayed with the hose. \n\nThen, the scientists\
    \ began a rotation; one of the original five monkeys was removed from the cage\
    \ and replaced with a new monkey. The new monkey liked treats, and had no experience\
    \ being sprayed with a water hose. When placed in the cage and offered a treat,\
    \ the new monkey naturally went to grab it. However, the 4 old monkeys would beat\
    \ up the new monkey to stop him from grabbing the treat and save themselves from\
    \ being hosed down. This rotation and process continued.\n\nEventually, all five\
    \ of the original monkeys were replaced. What is interesting is that the new monkeys\
    \ were never hosed down, the old monkeys had always prevented the new from getting\
    \ the treat and, in doing so, prevented the water bath. Yet despite not knowing\
    \ *why* they prevented each other from claiming the treat, they still did so simply\
    \ because they created a self-reinforcing system where monkeys get beat up for\
    \ trying to grab the treat. The monkeys had been trained to train other monkeys,\
    \ without even realizing it, and without knowing why.\n\nBack to the Matrix.\n\
    \nWhen Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, et al are adventuring inside the system, one of\
    \ the biggest threats is other people, the blue-pillers. There are numerous chase\
    \ scenes where Agents 'take over' blue-pillers in pursuit of red-pillers. In the\
    \ third film, Agent Smith actually takes over *everyone* in the Matrix in the\
    \ final battle with Neo.\n\nThis, I think, is one of the key points that is often\
    \ missed in analyses of the Matrix's message. Have you ever seen someone behaving\
    \ in a manner that just seemed wrong and consequently felt an overwhelming urge\
    \ to correct said behavior? Without even having a good *reason* to do so? \n\n\
    Have you yourself ever behaved in a manner that seemed perfectly reasonable *to\
    \ you*, only to be corrected by someone else in a way that appeared to you as\
    \ an overreaction?\n\nHave you ever restrained **yourself** from doing something\
    \ you considered legit, only because you were worried that others would 'correct'\
    \ you if you did?\n\nCongratulations, you're in the Matrix, surrounded by Agent\
    \ Smiths."

  selftext: "Thanks to /u/ReallyNicole for leading a great discussion last week on\
    \ the [Epistemological Problem for Robust Moral Realism](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/3q9oa6/week_17_the_epistemological_problem_for_robust/).\
    \ For this week I will also be leading a discussion on morality; specifically,\
    \ Kantian Ethics. \n\n**3 Approaches to Ethics**\n\nIn contemporary philosophy,\
    \ there are three major candidates for the correct ethical theory: what\u2019\
    s known as \u201CUtilitarianism\u201D or also as \u201CConsequentialism\u201D\
    , \u201CKantian Ethics\u201D or sometimes \u201CDeontology\u201D, and lastly \u201C\
    Virtue Ethics\u201D. In the 2011 [PhilPapers Survey results](http://i.imgur.com/0TeUncN.png?1)\
    \ we find that philosophers break fairly evenly across the three candidates. While\
    \ my focus today will be Kantian Deontology, I find that the best way to explain\
    \ contemporary Kantianism is through a comparison with its two major rivals. Let\u2019\
    s start by considering a case of minor immorality:\n\n> Mike is a fairly well-off\
    \ IT professional. One of his friends tells him about a local barber who is on\
    \ the brink of bankruptcy. In order to boost sales, this barber is slashing prices\
    \ to win over new clients. Frugal by nature and in need of a haircut, Mike decides\
    \ to go to this barber. On his way into the shop, Mike notices a large amount\
    \ of firefighter paraphernalia around the interior of the shop and infers that\
    \ he might get a further discounted haircut if he pretends to be a fireman. What\u2019\
    s the worst that could happen if Mike\u2019s lie gets found out - disapproving\
    \ faces? Mike is shameless in this regard and he\u2019d still get his haircut.\
    \ In the end, Mike decides to lie and is able to secure himself a haircut on the\
    \ house. \n \nAll plausible moral theories would agree that Mike acts immorally.\
    \ Nevertheless each will give a different account as to why and what is wrong\
    \ with Mike\u2019s lie.\n\n**Utilitarianism and Kantianism**\n\nWhat a Utilitarian\
    \ would have to say about Mike is that his action brings about the lesser good\
    \ rather than the greater good. The barber needs money more than Mike does. In\
    \ the barber\u2019s hands, the money would have gone further to adding to the\
    \ total happiness in existence than the happiness created by Mike lying and keeping\
    \ the money (because the barber is in a more desperate situation). Mike acts incorrectly\
    \ because he judges what\u2019s good or bad from his limited point of view (where\
    \ only his happiness and suffering seem to matter and the equal goodness and badness\
    \ of others\u2019 happiness and suffering are less perceptible to him) just as\
    \ someone might judge incorrectly that a figure in the distance is smaller than\
    \ it actually is because of how it appears to them from the particular point of\
    \ view they have on the world.\n\nKantians have a different take on Mike. The\
    \ problem with Mike\u2019s lie does not reduce to the balance of goodness and\
    \ badness it adds to the universe, the problem is that in lying to his barber,\
    \ Mike disregards the barber\u2019s own free choices.  What a Kantian (like myself)\
    \ would have to say about Mike, is that his action treats his barber as a mere\
    \ object in the world to be manipulated for his own purposes rather than as an\
    \ agent whose choices are of equal value to Mike\u2019s own. \n\nThe Kantian approach\
    \ to the wrongness of Mike\u2019s lie has three features in light of which we\
    \ can better see the differences between Utilitarianism and Kantianism: \n\n1.\
    \ For Utilitarianism, the only moral value is happiness and the one moral law\
    \ is this: An action is right if it would maximize net happiness over suffering,\
    \ otherwise it is wrong.  For Kantians, the only moral value is **free choice**\
    \ and the single and exceptionless moral law is to do whatever you choose for\
    \ yourself so long as you pursue your chosen ends in a way that respects the equal\
    \ worth of others\u2019 choices for themselves. \n2. Kantianism is a form of \"\
    **deontology**\" rather than \"consequentialism\". The wrongness the Kantian finds\
    \ with Mike\u2019s lie is with the act of lying itself - not with its consequences.\
    \ In lying one is (almost always) engaged in bypassing and dismissing the choices\
    \ that otherwise would have been made by the person to whom one lies. This means\
    \ lying is almost always morally wrong, even in cases when it is done altruistically\
    \ and for the greater good. When you lie to someone to save the lives of others\
    \ you are still disregarding the choices of the person you are lying to (otherwise\
    \ why would you need to be lying to them?), therefore a Kantian would still find\
    \ immorality even in cases of lying for the greater good. A Utilitarian, by contrast,\
    \ would allow actions of any sort so long as they bring about the greater good.\
    \ \n3. Kantianism views ethics as constituting a \"**side-constraint**\" on our\
    \ lives rather than telling us what to live for. A Kantian would argue that morality\
    \ does not demand a total restructuring of our lives around maximizing net happiness\
    \ over suffering in the world. A Kantian sees morality as imposing strict side-constraints\
    \ on how we pursue whatever stupid, foolish, small-minded, trivial, and selfish\
    \ or selfless goals we choose for ourselves. Morality does not care whether you\
    \ choose to send $100 to Oxfam or to spend $100 on a fancy haircut, morality only\
    \ demands that you not lie in your pursuit of either.  A Utilitarian, conversely,\
    \ might take issue with Mike paying for and pursuing a non-necessary, frivolous\
    \ expenditure like a haircut in the first place. Sure, Mike morally ought not\
    \ lie to his barber given that Mike\u2019s barber needs the money more than Mike\
    \ does. But starving children need the money more than either of them. Therefore\
    \ Mike either should refrain from getting the haircut and send the money to Oxfam\
    \ in order that it may save lives, or else Mike ought to lie and get the haircut\
    \ for free in order to do the same.  \n\nSo much for the contrast between Kantianism\
    \ and Utilitarianism (or some of it, at any rate). Now, what about Virtue Ethics?\
    \ What would the virtue ethicist have to say about Mike? \n\n**Virtue Ethics and\
    \ Kantianism**\n\nFor both Utilitarianism and Kantian Ethics there is one fundamental\
    \ value and one moral law that morality reduces to. For Virtue Ethics there are\
    \ many moral values (choice, happiness, truth, beauty, courage, fortitude) and\
    \ no overarching, exceptionless moral law. Instead, there is only the range of\
    \ very limited moral rules-of-thumb we are familiar with from ordinary life that\
    \ carry numerous implicit exceptions and often conflict with one another (e.g.\
    \ don\u2019t steal, don\u2019t lie, be respectful, treat others how you would\
    \ want to be treated). It is a skill to be able to correctly reason through what\
    \ to do by weighing and balancing the bewildering variety of values and rules\
    \ properly (as the immature and inexperienced cannot do, while the mature and\
    \ experienced can). \n\nThe most a virtue ethicist can offer in the way of a fundamental\
    \ moral rule is this: the right thing to do is whatever an experienced, mature,\
    \ and skilled expert at living human life would do. It helps if we think of the\
    \ Virtue Ethicist\u2019s rule for right action as analogous to the only sort of\
    \ overarching, exceptionless rule we could give for flirting: the right way to\
    \ flirt is however an experienced, mature, and skilled expert at flirtation would\
    \ do so. There is no way to codify how to flirt correctly into a rulebook that\
    \ the most immature, socially awkward human could then just memorize and deploy\
    \ in order to succeed at flirting with another human being. The right way to flirt\
    \ comes naturally to someone who has developed into the right sort of person (by\
    \ being shaped by experience, failure, imitation, training, practice, etc.). Similarly,\
    \ there is no codifiable rule or rules that determine right action. The right\
    \ thing to do in the course of human life will come naturally (sometimes by gut\
    \ reaction, sometimes only after extended deliberation) to someone who has developed\
    \ into the right sort of person. But according to Virtue Ethicists, there is no\
    \ rule like the one put forward by Utilitarians and Kantians.\n\nSo what about\
    \ Mike? Mike may not be sensitive to the right sort of considerations (the barber\u2019\
    s need, the due recognition of the barber\u2019s choices, the value of treating\
    \ people fairly and pulling your weight in society, the indignity of miserliness),\
    \ but - and I am assuming a lot about the reader here - as people who are mature\
    \ and more skilled at human life, we recognize the right action in a way that\
    \ Mike cannot (Mike is probably bad at flirting too). \n\nFor a Kantian (and a\
    \ Utilitarian), morality is not like flirting (or numerous other areas of human\
    \ life in which excellence hinges more on skill than possessing the knowledge\
    \ and willpower to follow the correct rule); for a Kantian (and a Utilitarian)\
    \ morality reduces to a single fundamental value and corresponding rule. \n\n\
    **Conclusion and Suggested Discussion Questions**\n\nI take the Kantian to be\
    \ closest to being correct about the nature of morality - although maybe there\
    \ are lessons to be incorporated that have historically been better captured by\
    \ the other two major alternative ethical theories.\n\n1. Discussion Question\
    \ - I suspect that many people can complete a question of the following form:\
    \ \u201CI\u2019ve heard that Kantians are committed to the following bizarre claim\
    \ about X, how can you and other philosophers think Kant is right about ethics?\u201D\
    \ \n2. Discussion Question - What\u2019s so important about free choice? Happiness\
    \ (and particularly my happiness) seems obviously good. So why is the Utilitarian\
    \ wrong and the Kantian right that we should respect free choice even at the cost\
    \ of happiness?\n3. Discussion Question - Why restrict morality to just the values\
    \ of happiness (i.e. Utilitarianism) or just free choice (i.e. Kantianism)? Isn\u2019\
    t Virtue Ethics correct to accept the irreducible and separate value of many things\
    \ and the uncodifiability of how to be a good person?\n\n**Further Reading**:\

    readers, and give a brief statement of the author''s own view on that question.


    **AIMS:** Our goal here is to provide a structured, respectful, and fruitful forum
    in order to educate newer members of our community and sharpen all of our critical
    thinking skills. To this end, we''re hoping for these threads to focus on very
    particular topics that are widely-discussed in contemporary philosophy and to
    pose questions that are approachable by people with very little experience in
    whatever that week''s subject is.


    **PARTICIPATION:** The first few threads we have planned are all being written
    by moderators, just so we can have some groundwork all set in order for us to
    test this idea. However, if we''re the only ones contributing threads, this won''t
    last long; there are only so many of us and we''re only familiar with so many
    topics. If this is going to work, we''ll need authors from the community. We''ve
    been tossing around some ideas for incentives such as flair, tuna, or sexual favors,
    but nothing is set in stone. If you have any ideas here, please let us know.


    **SCHEDULE:** So far we have a rough schedule for the next few weeks. Spaces afterwards
    are free for interested authors.

  selftext: '[Existential Comics: a comic about the inevitable anguish of leading
    a brief life in an absurd world. Also jokes.](http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1)


    The first comic, *The Machine*, is about the [persistence of personal identity](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/#ProPerIde).
    Some classic questions are tackled, such as whether or not when you go through
    a teleportation device which reassembles your body with different matter, it would
    kill you and create a clone, whether we are the "same person" after you lose and
    regain consciousness, etc.


    Many philosopher argue that these scenarios might cause different entities in
    one way or another, this comic basically explores the existential consequences
    of someone who believes that *100%*. In other words he isn''t just sitting around
    saying "there is no reason to believe we are a single unified being throughout
    our entire lives" at a cocktail party, he *lives* as though he *actually* believes
    that. This forces him to confront questions such as: what is his moral responsibility
    to prevent people from entering a teleportation machine to their apparent death?
    Can he have a meaningful life that only lasts one day (until he sleeps next)?
    What is is moral responsibility (if any) to his "future selves"? Etc.


    Anyway check out the comic, updates will be semi frequent as I have a bit of a
    cache of comics. There will be serious comics like this, but there will be more
    philosophy themed jokes. I have jokes written coming up about Russell, Wittgenstein,
    Zeno, Pyrrho, Nelson Goodman, Berkeley, Dostoyevsky, Sartre, Leibniz, and of course
    Socrates. Philosophy themed jokes aren''t really appropriate to this subreddit
    so this might be a good time to subscribe to /r/funnyphilosophy!'

    \ [David Hume](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/), and the nineteenth-century\
    \ anarchist feminist [Voltairine De Cleyre](http://www.voltairine.org/). His most\
    \ recent published work is on [contextualism in epistemology](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jusoe4mnnxwzde8/Pynn_Contextualism%20in%20Epistemology.pdf?dl=0).\
    \ You can download all his papers from his [academia.edu page](http://niu.academia.edu/GeoffPynn).\
    \ He has a number of Wi-Phi videos on:\n\n* [Critical thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cum3k-Wglfw)\n\
    * [Deductive arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jvQrpVQaYM)\n* [Abductive\

    * [Virtue epistemology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kLOisfkPw)\n* Contextualism\
    \ (coming soon!) \n\nGeoff's current research focuses on social epistemology.\
    \ [Miranda Fricker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Fricker) coined the\
    \ phrase [\"testimonial injustice\"](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/epistemic-injustice-9780199570522?cc=us&lang=en&)\
    \ to describe what occurs when some prejudice or bias causes a person's testimony\
    \ to be granted less (or more) credibility than it deserves. For example, imagine\
    \ a police officer who refuses to believe a suspect's truthful eyewitness testimony\
    \ simply because the suspect is black. Or consider how someone's rural accent\
    \ or stilted English can make you more skeptical than you'd otherwise be about\
    \ whether he is telling the truth. Intuitively, it seems wrong to let your prejudices\
    \ sway your credibility judgments, and it seems like people who are disbelieved\
    \ because of someone else's bias have a right to complain. But it's hard to say\
    \ why such treatment is wrongful.\n\nIn one paper, Geoff is developing an account\
    \ of the harm of testimonial injustice. The basic idea is that when you let your\
    \ prejudices sway your credibility judgments, you're degrading the speaker. Degradation\
    \ is a complex social harm where a person a mistreated in a way that represents\
    \ her as if she deserved the mistreatment in virtue of the kind of person she\
    \ is. Epistemic degradation may not be as dramatic or painful as torture, revenge\
    \ porn, or public humiliation, but it can be extremely demoralizing and have lasting\
    \ effects. Like all forms of degrading treatment, biased credibility judgments\
    \ reduce a person's social standing, encouraging and rewarding behavior that treats\
    \ them as if they deserved disrespect. (Working on this paper has also sparked\
    \ Geoff's interest in degradation, humiliation, shame, and other forms of psycho-social\
    \ harm.)\n\nGeoff's other current project is on testimonial injustice, plea bargaining,\
    \ and false confessions. More than 90 percent of criminal cases in the U.S. never\
    \ go to trial. Instead, a prosecutor extracts a guilty plea from a suspect by\
    \ either promising him a reduced sentence in exchange for a guilty plea, or threatening\
    \ him with a more severe charge should his case go to trial. While many people\
    \ who accept plea bargains are guilty, at least some plead guilty simply to avoid\
    \ the risk of a more severe punishment. Such cases involve a particularly nasty\
    \ form of testimonial injustice: enticing a speaker to lie in order to treat her\
    \ lie as if it were credible enough to justify punishing her. \n\nGeoff is also\
    \ the graduate adviser for Northern Illinois University's [top-rated](http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/maprog.asp)\
    \ [philosophy MA program](http://www.niu.edu/phil/graduate/index.shtml), which\
    \ caters primarily to students who want to get a PhD in philosophy, but do not\
    \ have the background to get into a PhD program directly. Like many other terminal\
    \ MA programs, NIU's offers full funding and living stipends, and Geoff maintains\
    \ [a guide to funding opportunities at terminal MA programs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w8wqvzgon4i2oxy/Philosophy%20MA%20Funding.pdf?dl=0).\

  selftext: 'Has anyone around here seen "her" with Scarlet Johannson and Joaquin
    Phoenix? It''s a phenomenal movie that raises really interesting questions about
    A.I. and persons.


    A brief synopsis of the plot (some spoilers):


    Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a recently divorced writer living in a near-future
    L.A. who purchases a highly intelligent operating system named Samantha (voiced
    by Scarlet Johannson). Though Samantha is nothing more than a disembodied voice
    in Theodore''s ear, their relationship soon grows past one between a user and
    his operating system to love between a man and a woman.


    What is shown is a world where there is no question that artificial intelligence
    can have consciousness. If one wants to claim that Samantha is not conscious,
    then he will have serious trouble explaining what it is that makes *Theodore*
    conscious. Both Samantha and Theodore are fully agent persons in the relationship:
    they both love each other, understand each other, and bring their own sides of
    each other fully to the relationship.


    What makes the movie interesting are the questions it raises from this initial
    premise. Assuming there are fully conscious artificial intelligences, what would
    it be like to fall in love with one? What responsibility does Theodore have to
    Samantha, as the *owner* of her hardware yet also her lover? What would it be
    like to love someone who is fully with you as a voice in your ear, yet whom you
    can never physically be in a room with?


    It seems to me that we assume that personhood has mainly to do with our status
    as *rational* or *intelligent* creatures (no one claims that a worm is a person),
    or even with our status as rational creatures who also *feel* emotions, but I
    think it''s easy to forget how important our physical embodiment is to our personhood.
    The difficulties "her" shows between two lovers when one is disembodied really
    highlighted this aspect of personhood. I think **Merleau-Ponty** may have been
    the philosopher to most fully explore this.


    If you haven''t seen the movie, then maybe these questions won''t strike you as
    so interesting. But I think the movie has enormous philosophical potential, and
    anyone interested in the philosophy of mind or personal identity should check
    it out.'

  selftext: "[Link to the previous discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2ws8k3/platos_republic_reading_group_week_0_introduction/)\n\
    \nHere we are. Book I of the *Republic*.\n\n**[327a]** The very first word of\
    \ this dialog is very important. The *Republic* begins with a descent (\u03BA\u03B1\
    \u03C4\u03AD\u03B2\u03B7\u03BD). This word implies a movement from top to bottom\
    \ that is very suggestive. Philosophers are commonly seen as lunatic creatures\
    \ that live in a different world from everyone else. They're also commonly mocked\
    \ by everyone because only rarely they would descent from their particular worlds\
    \ to join the population. It's no surprise there's a lot of jokes about philosophers.\
    \ One of the most famous is the one about Thales and the Thracian slave who mocks\
    \ him because he was so worried about his ideas that he couldn't even see a hole\
    \ right in front of him. This popular opinion about the philosopher is important\
    \ to us, because the *Republic* will eventually discuss what the philosopher is.\
    \ The *Republic* begins with a movement from top to bottom, a descent that will\
    \ be very important later in dialog in order to think about truth, education and\
    \ lack of education. There are three major descents in this book: 1) Socrates\
    \ leaving the Acropolis and going to the Piraeus; 2) the cavern man returning\
    \ to the cavern; 3) the descent to the underworld.\n\n**[327a to 328a]** Let's\
    \ spend some time describing the scenario of this dialog. Socrates *katabasis*\
    \ is leading him to the Piraeus. He's leaving Athens' Acropolis (something that\
    \ he does very rarely) and heading to the port of Athens. If you want to imagine\
    \ it with contemporany terms, imagine someone leaving the richest part of the\
    \ city and heading to the slums. The Piraeus possess an ambivalent nature: on\
    \ one hand, it is part of the polis, but, on the other hand, it is the place where\
    \ you'll find a lot of foreigners, where foreign gods are celebrated. He's visiting\
    \ the Piraeus with Glaukon. They met with Adeimantus and Polemarchus (whose name\
    \ means literaly \"Warlord\"), who literally force them to come with him. Polemarchus\
    \ doesn't even allow Socrates a chance to use persuasion: unless he can prove\
    \ he's stronger than Polemarchus and everyone following him, he wouldn't be able\
    \ to leave. I like to think that this forceful, violent approach is here because,\
    \ in many levels, the *Republic* is also a dialog about violence and war.\n\n\
    **[328b to 331a]** The party arrives at Polemarchus house. There, we have a lot\
    \ of important people. We have a lot of important sophists, like Lysias and Euthydemus\
    \ (both characters in other platonic dialogs). Thrasymachus is another sophist\
    \ that will be important for us here. Charmantides and Cleitophon are also there\
    \ (I don't know much about them. According to Plutarchus, Cleitophon was an unfaithul\
    \ disciple of Socrates).\n\nSocrates is welcomed by Cephalus. He's Polemarchus\
    \ father, an old, rich man who's a metic, a foreigner resident, a merchant of\
    \ weapons that made fortunes in the Peloponnesian War. Because of his old age,\
    \ Cephalus wants to pay all his debts with the gods. Both start a conversation\
    \ about old age that is not particularly interesting to me, but there's some beautiful\
    \ passages here. Socrates asks Cephalus if the old age is a hard time of life,\
    \ and Cephalus answers, in 329d, that what allows one to have only a moderately\
    \ troublesome life in the old age is to be harmoniously formed (\u03BA\u03CC\u03C3\
    \u03BC\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2, well formed. Think of cosmos, the perfect order of things)\
    \ and content with itself (\u03B5\u1F54\u03BA\u03BF\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2, satisfied).\
    \ Thanks to these things, one can be freed from \"mad masters\". And loves really\
    \ likes what he's listening from Cephalus, to the point he just wants to make\
    \ him talk more about his experiences as an elder. The *Republic* is also a book\
    \ about passions, about *p\xE1thos*, about *eros*. We'll be able to discuss later\
    \ in the *Republic* what does it means to be harmoniously formed and content with\
    \ itself.\n\n**[331a to 331d]** In some point of the conversation, Socrates fishes\
    \ a definition of justice in Cephalus' words. This is Socrates: while everyone\
    \ is partying and drinking wine, he's discussing what justice is. From what Cephalus\
    \ said, Socrates understood that justice means to speak the truth (\u1F00\u03BB\
    \u03B7\u03B8\u03AE\u03C2) and give back what one takes. Socrates uses an example\
    \ to show that you can be injust by speaking the truth and giving back what one\
    \ takes: if you return a spear to his insane owner and speak the truth with him,\
    \ you would not be just. Therefore, speaking the truth and giving back what one\
    \ takes can't be the definition of justice. Cephalus is in trouble, but he quickly\
    \ manages to make Polemarchus take his place in the conversation.\n\n**[322d to\
    \ 332e]** From now on, we're going to see several attempts to define what justice\
    \ is. Polemarchus comes with a definition that he claims Simonides said. According\
    \ to him, justice is to benefit friends and harm enemies. It is very important\
    \ to notice here that Socrates is using examples of art (\u03C4\u03AD\u03C7\u03BD\
    \u03B7, *techne*) to discuss the definitions. *Techne* is a very important word.\
    \ Not only it can be used to talk about the beautiful arts, but about any activity\
    \ that involves skill and knowledge (like driving a car, curing the ill, etc).\
    \ So Socrates is apparently suggesting that justice is an art. If medicine is\
    \ the most capable art to benefit friends and harm enemies in terms of health,\
    \ in what action (\u03C0\u03C1\u1FB6\u03BE\u03B9\u03C2, praxis, doing) and in\
    \ respect to what work (\u1F14\u03C1\u03B3\u03BF\u03BD, *ergon*, work, product)\
    \ is the just man (\u03B4\u03AF\u03BA\u03B1\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2, just) the most\
    \ competent to benefit friends and harm enemies? According to Polemarchus, the\
    \ just man is the most competent at waging war (\u03C0\u03C1\u03BF\u03C3\u03C0\
    \u03BF\u03BB\u03B5\u03BC\u03AD\u03C9, carry on war) and to fight together with\
    \ his allies (\u03C3\u03C5\u03BC\u03BC\u03B1\u03C7\u03AD\u03C9, to be an ally,\
    \ to fight with). According to Polemarchus, justice is something limited to war.\n\
    \nBy now you must have noticed that we're talking about war here. And this definition\
    \ is very important because it will appear later in the *Republic*. We should\
    \ also remember that the theme of war is very recurrent and important in greek\
    \ tradition. Just think about the *Illiad*. Think about Heraclitus transforming\
    \ war (*polemos*) in an ontological principle (fragment 53). We should definitely\
    \ pay attention to this, because the theme of war (and Polemarchus' definition\
    \ of justice) will appear a lot in the whole *Republic*.\n\nSocrates refuses Polemarchus'\
    \ definition of justice because it's patently obvious that justice is limited\
    \ to times of war. If Polemarchus is correct, then justice is useless in times\
    \ of peace and justice must be useful in times of peace, just like agriculture\
    \ is useful to produce food and the art of the shoemaker useful to produce shoes.\n\
    \n**[333a to 333d]** This is the third attempt to define what justice is. For\
    \ the use or acquisition of what is justice useful in peacetime? Polemarchus'\
    \ answer is: contracts (\u03C3\u03C5\u03BC\u03B2\u03CC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B9\u03BF\
    \u03BD, mark, sign) and partnerships (\u03BA\u03BF\u03B9\u03BD\u03CE\u03BD\u03B7\
    \u03BC\u03B1). This is, let's say, a juridical definition of justice.\n\nOnce\
    \ again, Socrates refuses the definition, still talking as if justice is an art\
    \ (is justice an art? You should start asking youself this question). The most\
    \ useful partner to play chess is the chess player and the most useful partner\
    \ to play the harp is the harp player, so in what partnership is the just man\
    \ the most useful partner?\n\nHere's the fourth attempt to define what justice\
    \ is: according to Polemarchus, the just man is the most useful man in money (\u1F00\
    \u03C1\u03B3\u03CD\u03C1\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD, money, coin) matters. But Socrates\
    \ also refuses this definition, again talking as if justice is an art. If you\
    \ wish to buy a horse, you should partner with the horserider and if you wish\
    \ to buy a ship, you should partner with the shipmaker or with the sailor.\n\n\
    **[335d to 336d]** Socrates made this huge discussion as an attempt to demostrate\
    \ that Polemarchus definition - justice is to benefit friends and harm enemies\
    \ is - can't be the definiton of justice because no craftsman can, with his art,\
    \ make someone worse related to his own domain. The music can't make someone ignorant\
    \ of music by the means of music, for example. But then, Thrasymachus' untimely\
    \ intervention happens. And the sophist is not only rising up against Socrates,\
    \ but he's also placing justice in is \"due place\": politics. Now we're about\
    \ to see Thrasymachus discourse about justice.\n\n**[338e to 339a]** This is the\
    \ first place where Thrasymachus will explain his position about justice. According\
    \ to Thrasymachus, each city set down laws for their own advantage: a polis governed\
    \ by democracts will nturally create democratic laws, while a polis governed by\
    \ a tyrant will create tyrannical laws. And when they do this, they are declaring\
    \ that their own advantage is just for those being ruled by them. Thrasymachus\
    \ will argue that justice is the advantage of the established ruling body (\u03C4\
    \u1F78 \u03C4\u1FC6\u03C2 \u03BA\u03B1\u03B8\u03B5\u03C3\u03C4\u03B7\u03BA\u03C5\
    \u03AF\u03B1\u03C2 \u1F00\u03C1\u03C7\u1FC6\u03C2 \u03C3\u03C5\u03BC\u03C6\u03AD\
    \u03C1\u03BF\u03BD). Finally, he'll claim that justice is the same everywhere\
    \ (\u03C0\u03B1\u03BD\u03C4\u03B1\u03C7\u03BF\u1FE6 \u03B5\u1F36\u03BD\u03B1\u03B9\
    \ \u03C4\u1F78 \u03B1\u1F50\u03C4\u1F78 \u03B4\u03AF\u03BA\u03B1\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD\
    ): the advantage of the stronger (\u03C4\u1F78 \u03C4\u03BF\u1FE6 \u03BA\u03C1\
    \u03B5\u03AF\u03C4\u03C4\u03BF\u03BD\u03BF\u03C2 \u03C3\u03C5\u03BC\u03C6\u03AD\
    \u03C1\u03BF\u03BD).\n\nThere's a lot of things here, so let's go slowly. First,\
    \ let's talk about what Bloom translated by \"advantage\" (I like to translate\
    \ it by \"convenience\"): \u03C3\u03C5\u03BC\u03C6\u03AD\u03C1\u03C9. It means\
    \ literally \"bring together\". Its Latin translation captures well the meaning\
    \ of the word: *convenire* means to unite, to be suitable, to assemble, and its\
    \ formed by *com-* (together) + *venire* (to come). According to Thrasymachus,\
    \ justice is convenience, is what comes together. That's actually a very traditional,\
    \ almost presocratical definition of justice. Socrates will even agree (in 339b)\
    \ that justice is indeed something of advantage and convenience. However, Thrasymachus\
    \ made a small addition here. A small addition that changes everything: justice\
    \ is not only something of advantage, but the advantage of the stronger, which\
    \ means, the advantage of the ruling body, the advantage of the principle (\u1F00\
    \u03C1\u03C7\u03AE, origin, principle) that is set down in the city.\n\n**[340c\
    \ to 341a]** Socrates tries to critique Thrasymachus' definition of justice by\
    \ imagining what happens when the ruler makes a mistake. If the ruler can make\
    \ mistakes, that would result that justice is what seems to be the advantage of\
    \ the stronger. After all, it is always possible for the ruler to not understand\
    \ what is advantageous for him, right? Thrasymachus protests. In 340c, we read\
    \ Thrasymachus saying: \"Do you suppose that I call a man who makes mistakes 'stronger'\
    \ at the moment when he is making mistakes?\" The sophist will explain this position\
    \ right below this question, in 340d-e, and, curiously, he'll do like Socrates\
    \ was doing before, using the analogy with *techne*, with art (is he also implying\
    \ that justice is an art?): speaking rigorously (\u03BA\u03B1\u03C4\u1F70 \u03C4\
    \u1F78\u03BD \u1F00\u03BA\u03C1\u03B9\u03B2\u1FC6 \u03BB\u03CC\u03B3\u03BF\u03BD\
    ), no craftsman makes mistakes. We do not call a man who makes mistakes about\
    \ the sick a doctor because of the very mistake he's making. The craftsman who\
    \ makes mistakes makes them because his knowledge (\u1F10\u03C0\u03B9\u03C3\u03C4\
    \u03AE\u03BC\u03B7, *episteme*, knowledge) abandoned him, and, in this sense,\
    \ he's no craftsman at all. In this sense, no ruler makes mistakes at the moment\
    \ when he's ruling.\n\nThe stronger is not any ruler, but the one who possess\
    \ the *episteme*, the knowledge. The stronger is not any ruler, but the one who\
    \ possess the *techne*, the art of governing. By possessing this art, the ruler\
    \ will not create laws that possess an appearance of being advantageous to him,\
    \ but ones that are truly convenient to him. Knowledge is power.\n\n**[341c to\
    \ 342c]** Starting here, Socrates will attempt to critique Thrasymachus' argument\
    \ about justice. He'll obey Thrasymachus' principle that no craftsman makes mistakes\
    \ and will take it to its ultimate consequences: the objective of the medic is\
    \ to treat the sick and not to earn money. The objective of the sailor is to make\
    \ sure the journey is safe for the travelers. Socrates will claim that art (\u03C4\
    \u03AD\u03C7\u03BD\u03B7) naturally exists (\u1F10\u03C0\u1F76 \u03C4\u03BF\u03CD\
    \u03C4\u1FF3 \u03C0\u03AD\u03C6\u03C5\u03BA\u03B5\u03BD) to provide for each his\
    \ own advantage (\u03C4\u1FF7 \u03C4\u1F78 \u03C3\u03C5\u03BC\u03C6\u03AD\u03C1\
    \u03BF\u03BD \u1F11\u03BA\u03AC\u03C3\u03C4\u1FF3 \u03B6\u03B7\u03C4\u03B5\u1FD6\
    \u03BD \u03C4\u03B5 \u03BA\u03B1\u1F76 \u1F10\u03BA\u03C0\u03BF\u03C1\u03AF\u03B6\
    \u03B5\u03B9\u03BD). For each art, there's only one benefit: to be as perfect\
    \ (\u03C4\u03AD\u03BB\u03B5\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2) as possible.\n\nSocrates wants\
    \ to argue here that the nature of the *techne* is to provide what is advantageous\
    \ to those things that are defective. For example, it's not enough for a body\
    \ to be just a mere body. It is for this reason that medicine was invented, because\
    \ the body is defective. In this sense, medicine doesn't consider the advantage\
    \ of medicine, but of the body (342c). In fact, any other art will consider not\
    \ its own advantage - because the art is already as perfect as possible (remember\
    \ Thrasymachus' argument about the craftsman) - but the advantage of others. Justice\
    \ isn't the advantage of the stronger, but the advantage of the weaker, of the\
    \ ones ruled by the stronger.\n\nWhat Socrates is trying to say is that such an\
    \ art that is worried with its own advantage cannot exist, because art naturally\
    \ exists to benefit the ones ruled by it. If Thrasymachus wants to keep his argument\
    \ that justice is the advantage of the stronger, he must be able to prove that\
    \ it is possible to think about an art whose objective is its own advantage. Only\
    \ by doing this Thrasymachus can defend the existence of a governor that acts\
    \ to his own advantage. Such an art exist? We'll talk more about this on Book\
    \ II, so please take note of this question.\n\n**(CONTINUES IN THE COMMENTARIES)**"

  selftext: "David Lynch\u2019s *Twin Peaks* invites numerous points of comparison\
    \ with\u2014and analysis in terms of\u2014the work of S\xF8ren Kierkegaard. This\
    \ should hardly surprise us, as Lynch himself has much in common with the Danish\
    \ philosopher-poet. He is, first of all, a master ironist who knows how to play\
    \ with vagueness and indeterminacy to great effect. He also gives his audience\
    \ the space to interpret his work without disruptive guidance\u2014compare this\
    \ to the authorial distance Kierkegaard effects through the use of pseudonyms\
    \ and his claim to have \u201Cno opinion about them except as a third party.\u201D\
    \n\nFurther, just as Kierkegaard makes cameo appearances in several of his pseudonymous\
    \ works, Lynch appears as Gordon Cole in several episodes of *Twin Peaks*. Kierkegaard\
    \ places narrative within narrative in *Either/Or* and *Stages on Life\u2019s\
    \ Way*; Lynch does so as well: *Invitation to Love* in *Twin Peaks*, and *Rabbits*\
    \ in *Inland Empire*. And certainly Lynch knows how to blend melancholy and humor,\
    \ earnestness and jest\u2014a Kierkegaardian skill we find not least in the Dane\u2019\
    s *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*.\n\nLynch has also, like Kierkegaard, fought\
    \ depression and found victory through his embrace of a religious life-view, albeit\
    \ one whose Eastern syncretism, nondual thinking, and universalist optimism are\
    \ foreign to Kierkegaard\u2019s more traditional Christian beliefs.\n\nWhat about\
    \ *Twin Peaks* itself? Many of the show\u2019s central themes are quintessentially\
    \ Kierkegaardian, and its characters often illustrate crucial Kierkegaardian concepts.\
    \ For example, not a few of the town\u2019s residents exhibit existential despair\
    \ in fairly noticeable ways, and help to illuminate the differences between particular\
    \ varieties of despair. BOB and Windom Earle are clear instances of what Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s pseudonym Anti-Climacus calls \u201Cdefiant\u201D or \u201Cdemonic\u201D despair,\
    \ while Leeland Palmer, Ben Horne, and agoraphobe Harold Smith resemble his portrait\
    \ of the \u201Cdespair of weakness.\u201D\n\nMeanwhile, several characters give\
    \ us a glimpse of what lies beyond despair. Dale Cooper, the Log Lady, and Major\
    \ Briggs represent, each in their own way, the religious life-view. They accept\
    \ the reality of the supernatural, and in a manner they are willing to consistently\
    \ act upon. The objects of their faith are generally supra-rational, concretely\
    \ (inter)personal, and even physically unrecognizable (or \u201Cincognito\u201D\
    ). Each of these characteristics of the modes and objects of faith are thematized\
    \ in Kierkegaard\u2019s writings.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface, of course;\
    \ there is more to come. In the meantime, watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12QQV3lyYj0)\
    \ and bring yourself back to the town with the absolute best pie and coffee."

  selftext: 'I was just reading a book that quoted the idea that human beings are
    simply the sexual organs of technology, and I was absolutely fascinated by it.


    The idea was that technology uses humans to continuously invent newer and more
    complex technology until the technology can reproduce itself and the human becomes
    obsolete. The human body is in that view nothing more than a way of controlling
    the environment in order to (from the point of the human) survive, but ultimately
    control leads to the singularity.


    I think that this is very similar to Daniel Quinn''s idea that our entire modern
    agricultural society is nothing more than a doomed way of trying to control our
    environment. However Quinn argues that we will not succeed in control because
    it is a vain attempt due to the fact that any control will lead to the need for
    more control as well as the destruction of the environment which we are trying
    to control.


    So there are basically two scenarios: either the singularity happens and technology
    manages to reproduce itself or we will fail before that because we self-destroy.

  selftext: "This is mainly an ethical question about the morality of abortion. My\
    \ stance on this is that I am pro-choice and that I do not think that a person's\
    \ right to live, in itself, gives that person a right to use another person's\
    \ resources (their body) to sustain or bring about that life. \n\nNow, for the\
    \ sake of this argument, I will agree to the notion that a baby is a person from\
    \ the time of conception and also that a woman has the right to control what happens\
    \ in/to her body. The typical pro-life argument argues that although a woman has\
    \ the right to control what happens in/to her body, it does not outweigh the person's\
    \ right to live and therefore abortion is impermissible. \n\nNow that seems plausible,\
    \ but i want you to imagine this scenario. You wake up laying next to an unconscious\
    \ famous violinist. It was found that he has a fatal kidney disease. His friends\
    \ canvas the local medical records and find that you alone have the right blood\
    \ work and can save him, so they kidnap you and hook the violinist up to you so\
    \ he uses your kidneys to filter the poisons out of his blood and your own. The\
    \ doctor comes in and says \"I'm so sorry about what they did. Had we known, we\
    \ would never have allowed it, but you are hooked up to him now and if you disconnect\
    \ from him, he will die. Don't worry though, it'll only be for 9 months at which\
    \ time he will be cured.\" Now are you morally required to submit to the situation\
    \ and allow it? Sure it would be awfully nice of you if you allowed it, but do\
    \ you have to? What if it were not 9 months but 9 years? Or longer still? What\
    \ if the doctor said \"Tough luck. I agree, but now you've got to stay in bed\
    \ hooked up to the violinist for the rest of your life. Because remember that\
    \ all persons have the right to live and a violinist is a person. Granted you\
    \ have the right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a persons right\
    \ to live outweighs that. So you have to stay hooked up to him.\" \nI'd say that\
    \ most people would consider this outrageous, which would suggest that something\
    \ really is wrong with the pro-life argument I described previously.\n\nThoughts?\
    \ Let's philosophize and stuff. \n\nSource: Judith Thomson \"A Defence of Abortion\"\

    \nA couple days before each AMA we will post an announcement post for the upcoming\
    \ AMA, where people can submit questions ahead of time for the philosopher(s)\
    \ doing the AMA. They will also take questions live during the AMA. \n\nWe hope\
    \ that everyone is as excited as we are to have some great philosophers join us\
    \ for some AMAs! If you are a professional philosopher and would like to arrange\
    \ an AMA to be held on /r/philosophy, please contact redditphilosophy (at) gmail.com.\
    \ Please use an official email address so that we are able to verify your identity.\
    \ We still have some slots for Fall 16, and we hope to do a Spring 17 AMA series\
    \ as well.\n\nHere are some blurbs for the currently announced AMAs:\n\n**Caspar\
    \ Hare**\n\nI am a philosopher -- officially Professor of Philosophy in the Department\
    \ of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT. I write about ethics, and about practical\
    \ rationality, and about metaphysics, and about connections between them.\n\n\
    I also teach a MOOC through edX: Introduction to Philosophy: God, Knowledge and\
    \ Consciousness. This philosophy course has two goals. The first goal is to introduce\
    \ you to the things that philosophers think about. We will look at some perennial\
    \ philosophical problems: Is there a God? What is knowledge, and how do we get\
    \ it? What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world? Do we have\
    \ free will? How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits\
    \ change?\n\nThe second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself.\
    \ This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills\
    \ more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors\
    \ and influential contemporary figures.\n\n**Kevin Scharp**\n\nMy areas of specialization\
    \ are philosophy of language, logic, metaphysics, philosophy of science, and the\
    \ history of analytic philosophy. My primary focus is the concept of truth and\
    \ the paradoxes associated with it. In 2013, Oxford University Press published\
    \ my book, Replacing Truth, in which I argue that the concept of truth is defective\
    \ (as evidenced by the liar and other paradoxes) and should be replaced for certain\
    \ purposes with a pair of concepts that, together, can play its role without generating\
    \ any paradoxes whatsoever.  This idea is also the focus of a paper published\
    \ (July 2013) in The Philosophical Review entitled \u201CTruth, the Liar, and\
    \ Relativism.\u201D\n\nWhile my book and many of my papers are on philosophy of\
    \ language and logic, I also work on philosophy of science (on applied mathematics,\
    \ measurement theory, units of measurement, and scientific change), metaphysics\
    \ (on pragmatism, fundamentality, truthmakers, and natural language metaphysics),\
    \ and the history of philosophy (on Locke, James, Russell, Carnap, Sellars, Goodman,\
    \ Quine, and Davidson).  I am also engaged with philosophy of religion (by advocating\
    \ a secular perspective on faith and the meaning of life in two recent public\
    \ events with religious authorities and a sequence of public lectures on the relation\
    \ between science and religion) and applied ethics (I have a paper in preparation\
    \ with Alison Duncan Kerr on abortion and the vagueness of \u2018person\u2019\
    ).\n\n**Kenneth Ehrenberg**\n\nAfter getting my JD from Yale in \u201997 I worked\
    \ for two years as a lawyer, one with the NYC Parks Dept and one with the firm\
    \ O\u2019Melveny & Myers (doing first environmental insurance defense and then\
    \ a private antitrust case against Microsoft), before going back for my PhD in\
    \ philosophy at Columbia. There I studied under Jeremy Waldron and Joseph Raz\
    \ and had worked with Jules Coleman at Yale and when he visited Columbia. My dissertation\
    \ was about doing legal philosophy by investigating the functions of law in general\
    \ and legal systems. Some of the ideas are reprised in my new book, [*The Functions\
    \ of Law*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-functions-of-law-9780199677474?cc=us&lang=en&)\
    \ (OUP 2016), although it is a completely newly written work with a completely\
    \ new ontological claim. OUP is offering a **30% discount on the book**: UK addressees\
    \ can use the code ALAUTH16 and US addressees can use the code ALAUTHC4 for 30%\
    \ off. After finishing my PhD, I took my first tenure track job at University\
    \ at Buffalo, SUNY, taking leave to do a term at Oxford as the HLA Hart visiting\
    \ fellow in 2010. In 2012 I took a second tenure track job at University of Alabama,\
    \ heading up their jurisprudence specialization. My main areas of interest are\
    \ in analytic general jurisprudence (especially the ontology of law and methodology\
    \ of legal philosophy), the relation of law to morality and grounds of legal authority,\
    \ and the epistemology of evidence law.\n\n**Geoff Pynn** \n\nGeoff Pynn (PhD,\
    \ Yale University) specializes in epistemology and philosophy of language, in\
    \ particular on issues concerning the nature, function, and norms of assertion,\
    \ and the semantics and pragmatics of epistemic terms like \"know\".  He also\
    \ regularly teaches logic and early modern philosophy.\n\n**Wi-Phi: Wireless Philosophy\
    \ Team**\n\nWi-Phi's mission is to introduce people to the practice of philosophy\
    \ by making videos that are freely available in a form that is entertaining, interesting\
    \ and accessible to people with no background in the subject.\n\nSince our aim\
    \ is for people to learn how to do philosophy rather than for them to simply learn\
    \ what philosophers have thought, we see it as equally important to develop the\
    \ critical thinking skills that are core to the methodology of philosophy.\n\n\
    We see this as a part of a larger mission: building our collective capacity to\
    \ engage in rational thought and discourse.  By providing the toolkit for building\
    \ better minds, we hope that Wi-Phi plays some small role in realizing that goal.\n\
    \n**Stephen Puryear**\n\nAfter earning a B.S. in mechanical engineering and working\
    \ in that field for four years, I quit and went back to school for philosophy.\
    \ That was eighteen years ago, and I've never looked back. After picking up an\
    \ M.A. in philosophy at Texas A&M, I got my Ph.D. at Pitt, did a two-year postdoc\
    \ at Stanford, and then joined the faculty at NC State. My research interests\
    \ include the German philosophical tradition, especially Leibniz, Kant, and Schopenhauer,\
    \ as well as historical and contemporary work in metaphysics and ethics. Most\
    \ of my published work concerns the philosophy of Leibniz, but I have also written\
    \ about Berkeley's idealism, Schopenhauer's ethics, Frege's philosophy of language,\
    \ and the metaphysics of space and time. I am currently writing a book about Leibniz's\
    \ idealism. In metaphysics, I am interested in such topics as infinity, continuity,\
    \ space, time, idealism, conceptualism, and monism; in ethics: obligation, consent,\
    \ rights, normative theories, animal ethics, and various other topics.\n\n**Roy\
    \ T. Cook**\n\nRoy T. Cook is Professor of Philosophy and CLA Scholar of the College\
    \ at the University of Minnesota \u2013 Twin Cities and a resident fellow of the\
    \ Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science. He has published over fifty articles\
    \ and book chapters on logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of\
    \ art (especially popular art). He is the author of *Paradoxes* (Polity 2013)\
    \ and *The Yablo Paradox* (OUP 2014). He co-edited *The Art of Comics: A Philosophical\
    \ Approach* (Wiley-Blackwell 2012) with Aaron Meskin and *The Routledge Companion\
    \ to Comics* with Frank Bramlett and Aaron Meskin. He is also a co-founder of\
    \ the interdisciplinary comics studies blog [PencilPanelPage](http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/pencil-panel-page/),\
    \ and hopes to someday write a book about the Sensational She-Hulk. He lives in\
    \ Minneapolis, Minnesota with his wife and approximately 2.5 million LEGO bricks.\n\
    \n**Carrie Jenkins**\n\nI'm a writer and philosopher based in Vancouver, BC. My\
    \ new book [*What Love Is And What It Could Be*](http://www.carriejenkins.net/what-love-is-and-what-it-could-be)\
    \ will be published by Basic Books in January 2017.\n\nI currently hold a Canada\
    \ Research Chair in Philosophy at the University of British Columbia. I am Principal\
    \ Investigator on the SSHRC funded project [*The Nature of Love*](http://www.themetaphysicsoflove.com/),\
    \ and Co-Investigator on the John Templeton Foundation funded project [*Knowledge\
    \ Beyond Natural Science*](https://www.templeton.org/what-we-fund/grants/knowledge-beyond-natural-science).\n\
    \nI studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and have worked at the University of\

  selftext: "My project here is not to offer a final defense of moral realism or even\
    \ to argue that the view is true. Rather, I hope to show why we should take claims\
    \ about the reality of moral facts seriously by attempting to overturn three naive\
    \ challenges to morality.\n\nTo preface my comments below, I\u2019ll say that\
    \ I think taking morality seriously involves taking our everyday moral claims\
    \ to be seriously claims to knowledge and engaging in philosophical discussion\
    \ about them on more than just a shallow level. The sort of people I have in mind\
    \ who are not taking morality seriously are people who are dismissing the reality\
    \ of moral facts without thinking critically about the issue and engaging deeply\
    \ in the philosophical issues surrounding realism. I\u2019m sorry to say it, but\
    \ I think that this thread is properly directed at a good number of the folks\
    \ who post on /r/philosophy or other subreddits where discussions about morality\
    \ take place. As I said earlier, it is not my hope to prove beyond a doubt to\
    \ these people that moral realism is true. Rather, it is my hope that they will\
    \ begin to take morality seriously.\n\n**What is the empirical challenge?**\n\n\
    This is a position that I see quite often among people who\u2019ve engaged with\
    \ a fair bit of popular science, but have not studied much if any philosophy.\
    \ In my experience, this includes many redditors as well as many undergraduate\
    \ students who are being exposed to broad perspectives (especially popular atheism)\
    \ on the world and what it\u2019s like for the first time. I take the challenge\
    \ to be roughly this:\n\n(EC) We should only take claims about knowledge seriously\
    \ if they involve something that we test empirically.\n\nThe advocate of this\
    \ challenge to morality will then go on to argue that there\u2019s no empirical\
    \ test you can devise for moral claims that will be a test of anything beyond\
    \ the subject\u2019s attitudes about whatever moral issues you present them with.\
    \ Therefore, there is nothing to morality beyond people\u2019s attitudes or beliefs\
    \ about what\u2019s right or wrong.\n\nThere are many obvious objections to this\
    \ argument; it\u2019s fairly common to point at things like mathematics or epistemology\
    \ as examples of claims that we should take seriously, in spite of the fact that\
    \ they seem to have no empirical basis. I will not be talking about these objections\
    \ because I think that advocate of EC can bite the bullet here and remain unconcerned\
    \ and I don\u2019t think that they get to the heart of the issue by attacking\
    \ EC directly. Instead, I hope to offer an attack on EC grounded in the ways we\
    \ have of knowing.\n\n**What ways do we have of knowing?**\n\nSo the most obvious\
    \ way we come to know things is through entailment. If I know that the bus arrive\
    \ at 8 o\u2019clock and it is 5 past 8, but the bus has not arrived, I know that\
    \ the bus is not on time. Obviously! However, this process of reasoning towards\
    \ knowledge won\u2019t work for everything that we rightly claim to know. I mentioned\
    \ that I know that the bus arrives at 8 o\u2019clock, but how do I know this?\
    \ Well perhaps I looked at the schedule printed at the bus stop and that\u2019\
    s what it said. But how do I know that the schedule was accurate? How do I know\
    \ that my eyes weren\u2019t deceiving me? And so on.\n\nWe can continue on and\
    \ on demanding justification for the justification we gave for our first claim,\
    \ that the bus arrives at 8 o\u2019clock. However, this won\u2019t do. If justification\
    \ proceeds downwards forever and ever then our everyday mundane beliefs about\
    \ buses and such are at stake for they all begin to take the form \u201CIf I\u2019\
    m justified in believing X, then I\u2019m justified in believing Y.\u201D Yet\
    \ we\u2019re never justified in believing X because there\u2019s another layer:\
    \ \u201CIf I\u2019m justified in believing Z, then I\u2019m justified in believing\
    \ X.\u201D And so on forever and ever. So in order to save all of our beliefs\
    \ (including our scientific beliefs) about the world, we need for our chain of\
    \ justification to stop at some belief that does not rely on any other belief\
    \ for its justification. \n\nWe need some solution to this worry about infinite\
    \ regress for justification. There have been several proposed over the years,\
    \ but the one I\u2019ll favor here is a form of foundationalism, the view that\
    \ there are some foundational beliefs that are justified without reference to\
    \ any other beliefs. I\u2019m going with foundationalism because it\u2019s (as\
    \ far as I know) the more popular view among philosophers right now and because\
    \ I find it to be a more satisfying solution. However, I think that my points\
    \ can probably be supported by foundationalism\u2019s main competitors, such as\
    \ coherentism, as well, so it shouldn't really matter.\n\nWhat sort of beliefs\
    \ do we have non-inferential justification for, then? Well an obvious candidate\
    \ would just be our day-to-day beliefs about the world. For example, when I see\
    \ the bus pulling up to the stop, I\u2019m justified in believing that the bus\
    \ has arrive. However, we\u2019re trying to avoid the regress worry, so we don\u2019\
    t want to ground my justification in some other beliefs. Instead, I think we can\
    \ ground it in the fact that it seems to me that the bus has arrive. Here I\u2019\
    m drawing upon a version of foundationalism defened by Pryor, Huemer, and others.\
    \ [Huemer summarizes the view:](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00002.x/full)\n\
    \n*(PC) If it seems to S that p, then, in the absence of defeaters, S thereby\
    \ has at least some degree of justification for believing that p.*\n\nSo if it\
    \ seems to me that the bus has arrived, then I am defeasibly justified in believing\
    \ that it has arrived. Note that this also works well for the sorts of beliefs\
    \ important to our scientific knowledge. If I\u2019m doing some test where I drop\
    \ two balls in a vacuum, it may seem to me that they hit at different times. However,\
    \ this seeming can be defeated. Perhaps by a timed sensor where the balls hit\
    \ the ground.\n\nBringing things back home to our discussion on morality, we have\
    \ many evaluative seemings. It seems to me as though abortion is morally permissible,\
    \ it seems to me that I should eat carrots, and so on. If this view about justification\
    \ is at least close to being correct, then I\u2019m thereby justified in believing\
    \ those things unless I encounter a defeater.\n\nOne might worry at this point\
    \ that there are defeaters for these beliefs or for evaluative realism generally.\
    \ However, in pursuing defeaters, they\u2019ve abandoned EC and, just I desired,\
    \ are taking morality seriously.\n\n**What is the ontological challenge?**\n\n\
    One might think that morality, and normativity generally, is ontologically messy\
    \ and that this serves as a defeater for our normatively-loaded claims. After\
    \ engaging seriously in the metaphysics of morality, this may very well end up\
    \ being the case, but what I\u2019ve experienced as the ontological challenge\
    \ is something more like the following:\n\n(OC) I can\u2019t imagine what sort\
    \ of stuff morality would have to be like in order to exist, so I shouldn\u2019\
    t believe that it does exist in any robust sense.\n\nMy approach here will not\
    \ be to spell out a completely metaphysics of morality. Instead, I hope to attack\
    \ the foundations for OC and give us reason to reject it. \n\nIt seems to me as\
    \ though this view is motivated by a wealth of experience with physical stuff\
    \ and what it\u2019s like. Whenever we talk about matter and we want to know more\
    \ about it, we have a wealth of historical discoveries about what stuff is *really*\
    \ made of. Even when these discoveries turned out to be incorrect, there\u2019\
    s some sense that there is some correct answer out there for us to find. The challenge,\
    \ then, seems to suggest that there is no such answer out there for normativity\
    \ and that we should abandon realism because of this. This seems too quick. While\
    \ it does seem right that, if there are some objective moral facts, they must\
    \ be unlike the stuff that we encounter in busses, tunas, or boulders, this ontological\
    \ opacity should not dissuade us from taking morality seriously. There are easy\
    \ analogies in the sciences. It\u2019s quite common these days to hear about how\
    \ *strange* or *weird* the picture painted by quantum physics is. But we don\u2019\
    t reject quantum physics for this reason. Similarly, we should not immediately\
    \ reject realism about morality because we cannot wrap our heads around how it\
    \ might work ontologically.\n\nAnother challenge to OC is that it forces us to\
    \ dispense of too much too quickly. I\u2019ve used \u201Cnormative\u201D and \u201C\
    moral\u201D interchangeably in this section. This is because they\u2019re both\
    \ claims of the same sort, claims about what we ought to do. This means that,\
    \ if they\u2019re both real things, they probably share an ontological status.\
    \ If we reject morality for uncritical ontological reasons, we also give up normativity\
    \ in general, which, if OC is right, means that we shouldn\u2019t take any claims\
    \ about what we ought to do seriously. We often say things like \u201CI ought\
    \ to exercise.\u201D This is not a moral claim, but it is a normative claim and,\
    \ if OC goes through, one that we ought not to take seriously."

  selftext: "I started asking myself the big questions of life during the end of eighth\
    \ grade through to the end ninth grade. The ones like: Why are we here? Is there\
    \ a god? If you don't believe in god or religion, then what is the meaning to\
    \ life at all? What makes us, us? Why do we behave the way we do? Does my mind\
    \ stay alive and just my body my dies? Etc\u2026\n So luckily, I had my dad who\
    \ I could ask these questions to, and he would always relate and say he thought\
    \ about this stuff too when he was my age. We bonded over this, and always shared\
    \ what we thought the answers were to these unanswerable questions. So now, here\
    \ I am 17 years old, and I'm wondering if everyone has had these thoughts, but\
    \ weren't able to express and openly talk about them with anyone. So to them these\
    \ questions may seem out of the norm. Maybe people got discouraged from thinking\
    \ about them, and just went on living how they were living. \n       Now, say\
    \ there's some way we can create an open environment to kids, to just introduce\
    \ a few of the concepts to them, any philosophical question. It just really needs\
    \ to be some abstract, true deeper meaning question. One that really triggers\
    \ that voice inside your head and start debating with your self. (Thats another\
    \ benefit, kids can become more aware of their awareness (consciousness) which,\
    \ I think, is really a good thing to be aware of at a younger age.) Ask Questions,\
    \ that may lead to other questions, to other questions, and this environment will\
    \ encourage debates and conversations, this way more people can seek a deeper\
    \ meaning to life, instead of maybe just pushing it off. \n\nEDIT** : Alright\
    \ but if not to young children, would you agree a mandatory philosophy class,\
    \ for high school, would be beneficial? I mean I'm in my senior year, and Philosophy\
    \ was offered once as an elective in high school, and all the class is, is movie\
    \ watching. "

  selftext: "Kierkegaard is first and foremost a Christian author. He identifies the\
    \ issue of his \u201Cwhole authorship\u201D as \u201C*becoming a Christian*\u201D\
    \ (*The Point of View*, p. 8; cf. pp. 55-6). In a final draft to his book *For\
    \ Self-Examination*, he writes: \u201CIt is one idea, this continuity from *Either/Or*\
    \ to Anti-Climacus, the idea of religiousness in reflection\u201D (*Journals and\
    \ Papers*, vol. 6, \xA76770). \u201CI hardly need say that by wanting to win people\
    \ [i.e., to win Christians within Christendom to authentic Christianity] it is\
    \ not my intention to form a party, to create secular, sensate togetherness; no,\
    \ my wish is only to win people, if possible all people (each individual), for\
    \ Christianity\u201D (ibid.). Moreover, in a draft of *Philosophical Fragments*,\
    \ Kierkegaard\u2019s Johannes Climacus writes, \u201Cthere has never been an atheist,\
    \ even though there certainly have been many who have been unwilling to let what\
    \ they knew (that the God [*Guden*] exists) get control of their minds\u201D (*JP*,\
    \ vol. 3, \xA73606). \n\nBut if this is so, what can non-Christians, atheists\
    \ especially, possibly get out of reading Kierkegaard? To this frequently asked\
    \ question, I offer the following as a starting-point:\n\n1. Kierkegaard is well-known\
    \ as the \u201Cfather of existentialism\u201D; he has had significant influence\
    \ not only on theistic existentialists (e.g., Buber, Marcel, Shestov, Berdyaev)\
    \ and quasi-theistic existentialists (Jaspers), but also their atheistic counterparts\
    \ (Kafka, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger). Kierkegaard has often been compared to that\
    \ other notorious arch-existentialist, Friedrich Nietzsche (see, e.g., Kellenberger\u2019\
    s *Kierkegaard and Nietzsche: Faith and Eternal Acceptance*). Though closer to\
    \ phenomenology than to existentialism, Emmanuel L\xE9vinas is another important\
    \ philosophical reader of Kierkegaard (see *Kierkegaard and Levinas*, eds. Simmons\
    \ and Wood; and Westphal\u2019s *Levinas and Kierkegaard in Dialogue*).\n\n2.\
    \ Kierkegaard has been influential in psychology. See, for example, Kresten Nordentoft\u2019\
    s *Kierkegaard\u2019s Psychology*, J. Preston Cole\u2019s *The Problematic Self\
    \ in Kierkegaard and Freud*, and existential psychotherapist Rollo May\u2019s\
    \ *The Meaning of Anxiety* and *The Discovery of Being*, ch. 5.\n\n3. Postmodern\
    \ theorists have been interested in Kierkegaard for his critique of rationalism,\
    \ and for his practice of \u201Cindirect communication\u201D (including but not\
    \ limited to his use of multifarious pseudonyms throughout his authorship). Additionally,\
    \ Jacques Derrida\u2019s *The Gift of Death* and John Caputo\u2019s *Against Ethics*\
    \ both make creative use of Kierkegaard\u2019s *Fear and Trembling*, and liberate\
    \ it (for better or worse) from its religious *telos*.\n\n4. Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s review of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s *Only a Fiddler*, in *From the of One\
    \ Still Living*, presents us with his notion that an author must possess a \u201C\
    life-view,\u201D which is \u201Cmore than experience\u201D but, rather, \u201C\
    the transubstantiation of experience,\u201D an \u201Cunshakable certainty in oneself\
    \ won from all experience, whether this has oriented itself only in all worldly\
    \ relationships (a purely human standpoint, Stoicism, for example),\u201D or \u201C\
    in its heavenward direction (the religious)\u201D has \u201Cwon the true Christian\
    \ conviction\u201D (*Early Polemical Writings*, p. 76). Kierkegaard criticizes\
    \ Andersen for lacking a life-view and for his feeble portrayal of the \u201C\
    genius.\u201D Kierkegaard, *contra* Andersen, maintains that a true genius is\
    \ not crushed by circumstance, \u201Cis not a rush candle that goes out in a puff\
    \ of air but a conflagration that the storm only incites\u201D (ibid., p. 88).\
    \ Later, in his unpublished *Book on Adler*, Kierkegaard contrasts the \u201C\
    premise-author,\u201D who depends on the reading public for validation, with the\
    \ \u201Cessential author,\u201D for whom the earnest communication of a life-view\
    \ is validation enough. (See also #9, below.)\n\n5. Kierkegaard\u2019s dissertation,\
    \ *The Concept of Irony*, treats of ancient Socratic irony and modern German irony,\
    \ irony in its \u201Cworld-historical validity,\u201D and irony in its \u2018\
    surgical\u2019 function \u201Cin enabling personal life to gain health and truth\u201D\
    \ (p. 328).\n\n6. Kierkegaard\u2019s *Either/Or*, Bk. I, composed by an imaginary\
    \ aesthete, contains a number of witty aphorisms comparable to Nietzsche\u2019\
    s aphoristic style (in \u201CDiapsalmata\u201D), an imaginary aesthete\u2019s\
    \ Mozart-eulogizing treatment of music\u2019s immediacy (in \u201CThe Immediate\
    \ Erotic Stages, or The Musical-Erotic\u201D), a theory of seduction (in \u201C\
    The Seducer\u2019s Diary\u201D), and much else besides.\n\n7. Though atheists\
    \ will find Kierkegaard\u2019s *The Concept of Anxiety* and *The Sickness Unto\
    \ Death* fraught with theological undertones, they will also find therein insightful\
    \ analyses of existential anxiety and despair. These concepts have been of interest\
    \ to both philosophers and psychologists (see, e.g., #1, above, and the works\
    \ of Rollo May in #2, respectively).\n\n8. Philosophers of emotions have found\
    \ in Kierkegaard a \u201Cclassical moral psychologist.\u201D See, for example,\
    \ Robert C. Roberts\u2019 \u201CExistence, emotion, and virtue: Classical themes\
    \ in Kierkegaard\u201D (*The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard*, ch. 7), David\
    \ Kangas\u2019 \u201CKierkegaard\u201D (*The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion*,\
    \ ch. 21), R. A. Furtak\u2019s *Wisdom in Love: Kierkegaard and the Ancient Quest\
    \ for Emotional Integrity* (esp. ch. 5), and Vincent A. McCarthy\u2019s *The Phenomenology\
    \ of Moods in Kierkegaard*.\n\n9. Kierkegaard\u2019s *Prefaces* constitutes satire\
    \ on the \u201Cvisible reading public\u201D and its relation to an author, and\
    \ on the misleading tendencies of book reviewers who mediate that relation. *The\
    \ Corsair Affair* and the entries on journalism in vol. 2 of *S\xF8ren Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s Journals and Papers* are also relevant in this connection.\n\n10. Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s pseudonym Johannes Climacus is primarily concerned with what it means to exist\
    \ \u201CChristianly-religiously,\u201D but Climacus also discerns a more basic\
    \ problem: \u201CIf people had forgotten what it means to exist religiously, they\
    \ had probably also forgotten what it means to exist humanly; therefore this would\
    \ have to be brought out\u201D (*Concluding Unscientific Postscript*, p. 249).\
    \ Consequently, much of *Postscript* is relevant to those who have little or no\
    \ interest in Christianity or religion.\n\n11. Throughout Kierkegaard\u2019s authorship,\
    \ but especially in *Two Ages: A Literary Review* (the section entitled \u201C\
    The Present Age\u201D), one finds a prophetic critique of modernity\u2019s impersonalizing\
    \ trajectory, including the concept of \u201Cleveling.\u201D For application of\
    \ Kierkegaard\u2019s thought to the Internet age, see the references I\u2019ve\
    \ listed in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/kierkegaard/comments/169s2y/the_present_age_and_reddit/c803ii2).\n\
    \n12. Kierkegaard\u2019s *Works of Love*, though largely based on the New Testament\
    \ scriptures, is arguably the kind of humanizing religion that non-theists should\
    \ want religious persons to practice (rather than the dehumanizing religion of,\
    \ say, Westboro Baptist Church). See also atheist philosopher Simon Critchley\u2019\
    s sympathetic analysis in his article \u201C[The Rigor of Love](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/the-rigor-of-love/).\u201D\
    \n\n13. Kierkegaard\u2019s letters offer us a more intimate look at one man\u2019\
    s love of the written word. One of Kierkegaard\u2019s principles of letter-writing\
    \ is to keep the recipient free from any obligation to respond: \u201CMy letters,\u201D\
    \ he says, \u201Chave this negative characteristic: they do not require a reply\u201D\
    \ (*Letters and Documents*, Letter #61). Kierkegaard also treats letter-writing\
    \ as akin to taking a walk with a friend or relative. Accordingly, here we find\
    \ Kierkegaard at his most personal and, on occasion, his most avuncular.\n\n14.\
    \ Kierkegaard\u2019s \u201CAttack on Christendom\u201D (see *The Moment and Late\
    \ Writings*) presents atheists with a lively example of a religion\u2019s rigorous\
    \ self-critique. This should be the spirit of any worldview, sacred or secular.\
    \ Just as Kierkegaard criticizes the State Church of which he was himself a faithful\
    \ member, atheists can likewise learn to reprimand their fellows for instances\
    \ of groupthink. Just as Kierkegaard attacks his and his father\u2019s beloved\
    \ pastor, Bishop Mynster, atheists should not be afraid to criticize popular atheist\
    \ writers (including the self-styled \u201Cfour horsemen\u201D of the New Atheism).\n\
    \n15. Within the aforementioned \u201CAttack,\u201D many atheists will also find\
    \ a welcome critique of religious (and specifically Christian) nationalism. Kierkegaard\
    \ refers to \u201C\u2018Christendom,\u2019 a Christian state, a Christian country,\
    \ a Christian world\u201D as \u201Can enormous illusion\u201D (ibid., p. 157).\
    \ On this theme, see Stephen Backhouse\u2019s recent book, *Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s Critique of Christian Nationalism*, which begins and ends with Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s remark, \u201CEvery effort that tends toward the establishment of a Christian\
    \ State, a Christian people, is *eo ipso* un-Christian, anti-Christian.\u201D\n\
    \nPerhaps needless to say, the above suggestions are not exhaustive, and the above\
    \ primary and secondary sources I have named only scratch the surface. Hopefully\
    \ they give an indication of the enormous breadth of Kierkegaard\u2019s influence\
    \ while at least gesturing at the appreciable depth of his thought as well. In\
    \ volumes 8\u201314 of the recent project, *Kierkegaard Research: Sources, Reception\
    \ and Resources* (editor-in-chief, Jon Stewart), one can trace further Kierkegaardian\
    \ influences on existentialism, theology, philosophy, art, poetry, literature,\
    \ literary criticism, the social sciences, and socio-political thought.\n\nLet\
    \ me also suggest that atheists need not attempt to extricate Kierkegaard\u2019\
    s philosophical import from his theological concerns. Even for those whose concerns\
    \ are strictly secular, it remains worthwhile to understand Kierkegaard on his\
    \ own terms, just as it is fruitful for the devout Christian to listen to and\
    \ learn from atheists such as Feuerbach, Nietzsche, and Camus without attempting\
    \ to \u201CChristianize\u201D them.\n\nI conclude with an excerpt from atheist\
    \ Julian Baggini\u2019s [recent article](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/julian-baggini-i-love-kierkegaard/)\
    \ on the Dane: \u201CKierkegaard was the master of irony and paradox before both\
    \ became debased by careless overuse. He was an existentialist a century before\
    \ Jean-Paul Sart[r]e, more rigorously post-modern than postmodernism, and a theist\
    \ whose attacks on religion bit far deeper than many of those of today\u2019s\
    \ new atheists. Kierkegaard is not so much a thinker for our time but a timeless\
    \ thinker, whose work is pertinent for all ages yet destined to be fully attuned\
    \ to none.\u201D"

  selftext: "# Week 0: Introduction to the new series\n\n## Purpose of this series\n\
    \nEvery Monday (starting 7/13), we'll kick off a new weekly discussion on a specific\
    \ philosophical topic. Each week, the discussion leader will introduce a new philosophical\
    \ topic in a short and accessible post. Then the discussion leader, usually a\
    \ graduate student or faculty member with field-specific expertise, will lead\
    \ a weeklong discussion on the chosen topic. Panelists from /r/askphilosophy and\
    \ other experienced philosophers will check in to guide discussion as well. You\
    \ can find the schedule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/discussion),\
    \ as well as some (highly optional) related readings for any over-achievers out\
    \ there. \n\n## A call to action\n\nHere's how you can help. Let us know in the\
    \ comments section what topics you'd like us to cover, and we'll do our best to\
    \ find someone with the relevant expertise. If you have some relevant expertise,\
    \ we encourage you to volunteer to lead a session. Shoot a PM to /u/oneguy2008\
    \ or /u/ADefiniteDescription with your academic background and a tentative topic.\
    \ Most contributors will be grad students and up, but exceptions can be made on\
    \ a case-by-case basis. And if you can't share your expertise as a discussion\
    \ leader, we encourage you to join the conversation in the comments section!\n\
    \n## Tips for engaging in philosophical discussion.\n\nWe're working super-hard\
    \ to make this series feel like a seminar discussion. So in addition to the usual\
    \ sidebar rules and [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/arguments),\
    \ here are some tips for engaging in a fulfilling and productive philosophical\
    \ discussion. \n\n1. *Ask for clarification.* A very typical way to begin a philosophical\
    \ discussion is to ask for clarification. Not sure what OP means by a term? What\
    \ they would say about X? Confused by something you saw in the comments section?\
    \ Before you attack, make sure that you're on the same page. The best philosophers\
    \ that I know frequently ask for clarification during a discussion, and will respect\
    \ you for doing the same.\n\n2. *Be charitable.* We don't always express ourselves\
    \ as clearly or as well as we'd like to. When possible, put the kindest possible\
    \ interpretation on your interloctors' words.\n\n3. *Read the original post.*\
    \ The purpose of this series is to hold a focused discussion. That won't be possible\
    \ unless we all start on the same page.\n\n4. *Civility is king.* While disagreement\
    \ is fine, even expected, make sure to be kind and maintain a professional tone.\
    \ Uncivil posts will be promptly deleted. Grad students and up -- you set the\
    \ example. We expect you to be model citizens in this regard. \n\n5. *Stay on\
    \ topic.* We've made an effort to focus each week's discussion on a bite-sized\
    \ topic. While new topics sometimes arise during discussion, when possible try\
    \ to keep the discussion focused on the topic at hand. \n\n6. *Small is big*.\
    \ Many of the most productive philosophical discussions focus on very narrow points\
    \ and spend a long time trying to get a clear view of them. This is much easier\
    \ than trying to settle an entire domain of philosophy in one fell swoop.\n\n\
    7. *Find common ground*. It's a fact of life that your background views will differ\
    \ substantially from those of your interlocutors. One of the most difficult and\
    \ rewarding activities in philosophy is trying to find a way to make your views\
    \ persuasive to those with different sympathies from your own. This is often a\
    \ very good way to keep discussions moving. \n\n8. *There's more to do than just\
    \ attack*. Philosophical discussion does not consist entirely, or even primarily\
    \ in criticism. In addition to criticizing, try to: extend others' ideas to new\
    \ contexts; find precedent and supporting arguments; tease out implications of\
    \ their ideas; refine and clarify their proposals; identify challenges for their\
    \ accounts and explore strategies for overcoming them.\n\n9. *Write clearly, briefly\
    \ and accessibly*. Remember that time when someone wrote a three-page essay in\
    \ response to your two-line comment, and you couldn't make heads or tails of what\
    \ they were saying? Of course you do. Don't be that guy. Write with your readers\
    \ in mind, using clear, sharp prose, and be sure to introduce any terminology\
    \ or technical results which other redditors might not be familiar with.\n\n10.\
    \ *Upvote liberally. Downvote sparingly.* The upvote button does not express agreement,\
    \ but appreciation for a well-written post. The downvote button is not a `disagree'\
    \ button. Use this only for exceptionally poor or hostile posts.\n\n11. *Cross-reference.*\
    \ Like what /u/username said in the comments section? Give them a shout out! Not\
    \ sure what they'd say about a particular point? Want to call OP over for an opinion?\
    \ Let them know! Don't let each thread of the comments section become isolated.\
    \ \n\n12. *Observe others.* The best way to learn how to engage in a philosophical\
    \ discussion is through observation. How do others react when they disagree? When\
    \ they're unsure how to interpret a point? How do they respond to criticism? What\
    \ points do they consider relevant, and which points do they find particularly\
    \ interesting? We've asked grad students and faculty to model good philosophical\
    \ discussion throughout this series, but all comments are worth observing.\n\n\
    13. *Admit defeat.* On the defensive? Not sure how to salvage your original idea?\
    \ It's okay to be wrong! Instead of hanging on by a thread, consider acknowledging\
    \ your opponents' points and trying a new tack.\n\n14. *Have fun!* Properly done,\
    \ philosophical discussions can be fun and rewarding. Bear this in mind as you\
    \ enter the discussion, and in your interactions with others. \n\n## Shout-outs\n\
    \nOne of our goals with this series is to draw the greater reddit philosophical\
    \ community closer together. We're excited to acknowledge the help of the following\
    \ subs and extend a warm welcome to their users:\n\n/r/askphilosophy; /r/logic;\
    \ /r/academicphilosophy; /r/philosophyofscience; /r/philosophyofmath; /r/philosophybookclub;\
    \ /r/historyofideas.\n\nAlso, warm thanks to all of the contributors and organizers\
    \ from our previous series, who you will recognize by their \u03A6 flair. Special\
    \ thanks to those on our [wall of fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/discussion#wiki_wall_of_fame).\n\

    \ \n\n~~p2: If i exist, in any form, there must, by extension, be an existence\

    \ above, as i have incorrectly jumped to a fallacious conclusion regarding premise\
    \ 4.\n\n**Edit: Continuing from the above**\n\nBefore proposing a revision of\
    \ my above premises, i'd like to separate three distinct aspects of reality with\
    \ the below;\n\n1. Actuarial reality - Reality as it exists outside of, and regardless\
    \ of, perception and or interpretation by any consciousness. Dependant only on\
    \ itself.\n\n2. Perception - The ways in which we receive information about actuarial\
    \ reality, objectively fallible by nature and dependent on actuarial reality.\n\
    \n3. Interpretation - The ways in which a consciousness interprets the information\
    \ it receives from its senses as perceptions and constructs ideas from them. Objectively\
    \ fallible and dependent on perception, but not actuarial reality.\n\nThe consensus\
    \ of these divisions being that perception and interpretation form the basis for\
    \ consciousness. (A brain without the ability to perceive reality, and that has\
    \ never perceived reality, cannot interpret reality, and thus cannot be conscious)\n\
    \n* p1: If i do not exist in any form, then i cannot experience any form of existence.\
    \ \n\n* p2: If i do not exist outside a simulated reality, and perceive a simulated\
    \ subset of existence, (Eg, a computer program), i must then be a product of a\
    \ reality in which the simulation belongs. Otherwise, i could not experience the\
    \ illusion of existence.\n\n* p3: If i do not exist within the boundary and conditional\
    \ parameters of actuarial reality, i do not exist.\n\n* p4: If i exist, in any\
    \ form, there must, by extension, be an existence in some form to necessitate\
    \ my ability to perceive and interpret it.\n\n* p5: Actuarial reality exists if\
    \ i exist.\n\n* p6: If i do not exist, i cannot know if actuarial reality exists.\n\
    \n* p7: If i cannot know if actuarial reality exists if i do not exist, i must\
    \ exist as a subset of it, under it's parameters, in order to exist.\n\n* p8:\
    \ I exist, because i am experiencing existence. \n\nTherefore, if i exist, an\
    \ actuarial reality exists separate from my experiences and interpretations.\n\
    \nI appreciate further criticisms.\n\n**EDIT: I've been incredibly busy/tired/drunk\
    \ lately and haven't had time to sift through a lot of the newer comments, but\
    \ i'll be getting to them as soon as i can. Thanks to everyone who contributed\
    \ some very useful and helpful insight.**"

  selftext: "Disclaimer: I am not an expert, nor an authority on philosophical matters.\
    \ I am simply a man stating his own personal observations\n\nHi /r/philosophy,\n\
    \nI will keep this as short as I possibly can so as not to bore anyone with my\
    \ ramblings. I have recently rekindled my interest in philosophy and in learning\
    \ about the nature of AI and whether they can \"think\" or be \"conscious\" of\
    \ themselves, it seems that the most widely accepted conclusion that I've seen\
    \ is that AI (or machines for that matter) cannot and will never be able to truly\
    \ understand information. I believe this to be true as well, seeing as machines\
    \ rely on outside influences to input information for them to output operations.\
    \ Humans, I believe are the same way. Without senses or inputs, we have no awareness\
    \ of anything external or internal if we are born without senses (we likely would\
    \ not know that we are alive). But because we have the ability to be constantly\
    \ in reception of knowledge due to having sensors, we can be confident that not\
    \ only we exist, but everything outside of ourselves that we are observing also\
    \ exists.\n\nSome have argued that our minds may be no more than extraordinarily\
    \ complex computers because they perform similar functions to compute information\
    \ using outside inputs. This could be concluded only if you ignore the fact that\
    \ humans have the ability to:\n\nA) Communicate\nB) Formulate original thought\
    \ (to a degree)\nC) Ask questions\n\nI believe that these things set us apart\
    \ from machines in the sense that we have control over our actions and are not\
    \ relegated to only operating within the input received through experiences. In\
    \ this [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) John Searle\
    \ proposes the question as to whether or not an AI can truly understand a language\
    \ or any information for that matter. Are they simply regurgitating what they\
    \ are given with no cognitive understanding even if they are able to pass the\
    \ [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) ? I believe that the\
    \ Turing Test is not sufficient to determine a machine's intelligence. Rather,\
    \ it determines whether or not we are able to distinguish the difference between\
    \ real conversation using common dialogue and true communication between humans.\
    \ That is a fault in human perception and not a definitive way to state that a\
    \ machine is intelligent. \n\nHowever, if machines are not able to understand\
    \ language and truly create an original conversation on their own, then how do\
    \ we as humans understand words and languages? What are words and languages? And\
    \ furthermore, what is knowledge and how do we receive, retain, and create knowledge\
    \ or understanding?\n\nMy reasons for making this post is not to ask the questions\
    \ stated above. I want to propose that philosophy itself has major fallacies due\
    \ to the fact that it relies on the accepting of statements that are simply \"\
    what ifs\". Most of philosophy is inconclusive and often creates more questions\
    \ than it answers. Ultimately, we cannot understand all that their is to understand,\
    \ but learning more about the existence we inhabit is fascinating. However, my\
    \ question is: Where does the rabbit hole end? What are we searching for and why\
    \ are we the only living beings that we are aware of that seek such profound knowledge?\
    \ Obviously, we've obtained knowledge in the past for our survival and for technological\
    \ advances, but what do we get out of recreational knowledge? Why are we interested\
    \ in knowing how many moons Jupiter has? Why do we categorize things? Why do we\
    \ ask questions?\n\nThis is the problem I've run into with philosophy. Although\
    \ it can brilliantly answer questions and allow us to explore the depths of our\
    \ human experiences, it still poses the same question to itself that humans ask\
    \ themselves. Why am I here?"

  selftext: "In a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2nexmn/kierkegaards_concept_of_indirect_communication/)\
    \ we observed Kierkegaard\u2019s concept of existential truth\u2014truth consisting\
    \ not in the possession of information, but in the cultivation of virtue, of moral\
    \ character. Its communication, we noted, cannot be direct in the way that one\
    \ might communicate speculative or scientific knowledge. Here Kierkegaard nicely\
    \ summarizes the point for us:\n\n\u201CVirtue cannot be taught [directly]; that\
    \ is, it is not a doctrine, it is a being-able, an exercising, an existing, an\
    \ existential transformation, and therefore it is so slow to learn, not at all\
    \ simple and easy as the rote-learning of one more language or one more system\u201D\
    \ (*JP* 1: 1060).\n\nThe problem with the modern age, as Kierkegaard conceives\
    \ it, is that it has forgotten about this kind of truth, or forgotten that it\
    \ consists in the exercise of ethical capability, and that it must be taught and\
    \ learned through indirect communication (see *JP* 1: 657, p. 304). It is especially\
    \ here that Kierkegaard sees himself retrieving Socrates\u2019 maieutic and Aristotle\u2019\
    s rhetoric.\n\nFor Kierkegaard, communication typically involves four elements:\
    \ object, communicator, receiver, and the communication itself. The communication\
    \ of *knowledge* focuses on the object. But when the object drops out, we have\
    \ the communication of *capability*, which then divides into a very familiar Kierkegaardian\
    \ trichotomy: If communicator and receiver are equally important, we have *aesthetic*\
    \ capability; if the receiver is emphasized, *ethical* capability; if the communicator,\
    \ *religious* capability. Existential truth, in the strict sense, is the exercise\
    \ of the last two: ethical and \u2018ethical-religious\u2019 capacity. They are\
    \ to be communicated in \u2018the medium of actuality\u2019 rather than the \u2018\
    medium of imagination or fantasy\u2019 (see *JP* 1: 649-57, *passim*, esp. 657,\
    \ pp. 306-7; on actuality vs. imagination see also *Practice in Christianity*,\
    \ pp. 186ff.).\n\nWhat this means, on Kierkegaard\u2019s view, is that we moderns\
    \ have abolished the semiotic conditions for the possibility of genuine moral\
    \ and religious education. A few will smile at this and think, who cares? But\
    \ Kierkegaard has no interest in taking offense at the nihilists, relativists,\
    \ atheists, or agnostics in his audience. No, he himself is smiling. At whom?\
    \ At those who still think and speak in superficially moral and religious terms;\
    \ at the crowds of people who are under the delusion that their concepts and talk\
    \ have the reference they think they have. The upshot? That prior to Nietzsche,\
    \ Kierkegaard had already proclaimed the death of God. For remember: atheist though\
    \ Nietzsche was, for him the death of God was not a metaphysical truth-claim about\
    \ God\u2019s nonexistence, but a prophetic description of the cultural *Zeitgeist*\
    \ that was \u2018already\u2019 but \u2018not yet\u2019 through with *belief* in\
    \ God. So also for Kierkegaard. This, and not anything Dawkins would later pen,\
    \ is the true \u2018God delusion\u2019\u2014not the belief in God, but the belief\
    \ *in* belief in God.\n\n\u201CChristendom has abolished Christ,\u201D says Anti-Climacus\
    \ (*Practice*, p. 107). But it is tragically unaware it has done so."

  selftext: "I saw 'I Heart Huckabees' a while back. I didn't really think much of\
    \ it back then. I saw it as an incredibly artistic indie film with no substantial\
    \ meaning to it. However, over the past couple years, I've spent a lot of my time\
    \ reading, discussing and just thinking about philosophy. \n\nI recently watched\
    \ the film this weekend with my brother, who I discuss philosophy the most with.\
    \ After watching the film again, I was blown away at how much philosophy was in\
    \ the film and how accurate it was to the study of philosophy in general. I checked\
    \ the wikipedia and was disappointed to find that they for the most part disregarded\
    \ this aspect to the film. It is very important to at least know this analysis\
    \ if you want any chance at actually understanding this film without a strong\
    \ background in philosophy.\n\nEach of the characters represent a different philosophical\
    \ concept. As the story progresses, the events and even the dialog represent how\
    \ each concept would respond to other concepts. \n\nCharacters with corresponding\
    \ philosophical idea\n\n1. Albert (Jason Swartzman) - The **self**. The subject\
    \ that is going through an existential crisis. Ultimately, his character arks\
    \ from a superficial existence, to a nihilistic existence, and finally to self-actualization(or\
    \ authenticity). \n\n2. Catherine (Isabelle Huppert) - **Nihilism**. She is the\
    \ ultimate enemy in the film. As an existential self, he must overcome this powerful\
    \ idea in order to derive meaning in life.\n\n3. Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and\
    \ Vivian (Lily Tomlin) - While both represent two very different ideas, they deserve\
    \ to be put together. Bernard takes the holistic metaphysical perspective. He\
    \ is the 'a priori knowledge'. He asks the most basic philosophical questions,\
    \ like **ontology**(existence itself). He's always focused on the blanket, the\
    \ big idea and tries to understand the details of his life in the context of the\
    \ blanket. He understands the 'parts' *through* the 'whole'. Vivian takes the\
    \ reductionist metaphysical perspective. She is the 'a posteriori knowledge'.\
    \ She represents science and **epistemology**. Notice she only observes the experience\
    \ itself and takes notes. She tries to understand the blanket by building up the\
    \ details themselves. She understands the whole through adding the parts. While\
    \ Bernard and Vivian may appear to fight and be disjointed at times, they are\
    \ actually happily married. Neither one is more powerful than the other and neither\
    \ one tells the other one that they are wrong. \n\n4. Brad (Jude Law) - He represents\
    \ corporate America and **superficial everyday life** in general.  Brad does not\
    \ understand the deep questions of life, but only accepts the answers that are\
    \ on the surface. For instance, Brad himself is not interesting. He makes himself\
    \ appear interesting by repeatedly telling the same Shania Twain story over and\
    \ over again. He tries to understand philosophy at times, but sees philosophy\
    \ as a means to end and not an end in itself. This is why his pursuit of philosophy\
    \ ends in failure. He ends up having a miserable life.\n\n5. Tommy (Mark Wahlberg)\
    \ - He represents the man who only accepts half of philosophy, **reductionism**.\
    \ He only believes Vivian's philosophy, and only emphasizes how everything is\
    \ broken up (the parts). This can also be called scientism (It *only* takes science\
    \ as a credible authority to knowledge). Tommy leads  Albert to Catherine (nihilism)\
    \ because he fails to recognize the universe as a whole thing. When he finally\
    \ meets Dawn (holism, explained below), he and Albert (self) can achieve self-actualization.\
    \ Tommy is also constantly referred to as Albert's other in the film. ['Other'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other#The_idea_of_the_Other)\
    \ is a continental philosophical concept that the 'self' (Albert) uses to define\
    \ itself. Without Tommy (the 'other'), Albert has nothing to base his 'self' on,\
    \ which he needs to know to self-actualize and become authentic.\n\n6. Dawn (Naomi\
    \ Watts) - She is the foil character to Tommy (reductionism). She only accepts\
    \ the opposite half of philosophy from Tommy, which is **holism**. She only knows\
    \ the 'a priori' knowledge of Bernard (the blanket). She no longer recognizes\
    \ the 'parts' and everyday superficial observations. In the beginning, she is\
    \ with Brad (superficial everyday life) and only cares about the appearance and\
    \ surfaces, just like Brad. However, when she discovers philosophy, she retreats\
    \ from the world and becomes incapable of living in it properly. This isn't the\
    \ appropriate response to philosophy either, but she is still a crucial component\
    \ to understanding philosophy. Even though she looks crazy to the real world,\
    \ she just has a completely different understanding of the world that the everyday\
    \ superficial world (Brad) needs to recognize, but inevitably fails. When she\
    \ gets with her foil character, Mark, the 'self' (Albert) becomes authentic. \n\
    \n7. The African - He represents **coincidence** and how the self (Albert) tries\
    \ to use coincidences/accidents to define their existence. He ultimately is not\
    \ meaningful, but strays the self from the path to authenticity. Ultimately, the\
    \ coincidences lead the 'self' to Christianity. While I don't necessarily think\
    \ he portrayed the Christians in a poor light (They took a Sudanese refugee into\
    \ their home after all), the director certainly portrayed them as being hypocritical\
    \ when they are faced with Tommy (science, reductionism). \n\nTL;DR: This is just\
    \ a basic philosophical summary of I Heart Huckabees. I don't know if anyone will\
    \ care enough to read it, but I took the time to figure it out, so I thought I\
    \ might as well post it. "
